This remote connection offers several benefits:
- Your code runs in the DevBox runtime, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
- You can access your project from anywhere, on any device with Cursor installed.
- Collaboration becomes easier as team members can connect to the same DevBox runtime.

## Run Your Application

<div className='steps [&_h4]:step'>

<h4>Open the Terminal</h4>

<h4>Navigate to Your Project Directory</h4>

If you're not already there, navigate to your project directory.

<h4>Start Your Development Server</h4>
