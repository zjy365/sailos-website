## What Happens Next?

After creating your project, Sealos DevBox will set up the development environment based on your configurations. This process includes:

1. Provisioning the necessary resources (CPU, memory) for your project.
2. Setting up the chosen framework or language environment.
3. Configuring the network settings and domain.

Once the setup is complete, your project will appear in the DevBox List, where you can manage and access it.

## Next Steps

After creating your project, you're ready to start developing. The next step is to connect to your project using an IDE and begin building your application. Refer to the "Develop" guide for detailed instructions on how to connect and start coding.
