## What is AFFINE? The Complete Open-Source Knowledge Management System

[AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE) is a powerful open-source alternative to Notion and Miro that prioritizes privacy and security by saving your notes locally. If you're looking for a knowledge management tool that combines document editing with whiteboard functionality while maintaining complete control over your data, AFFINE offers the perfect solution.

Built with Rust and TypeScript, AFFINE provides developers with maximum creative freedom while requiring minimal setup - just a single command runs the entire project. This comprehensive guide will walk you through deploying your own private AFFINE instance using Sealos, ensuring you maintain data privacy while enjoying all premium features completely free.

Unlike Miro and Notion which focus specifically on whiteboards and pages, AFFINE positions itself as an integrated KnowledgeOS. It uses kanban boards, tables, and rich text paragraphs as building blocks to create pages or whiteboards where you can perform document editing, data processing, or brainstorming in one unified environment.

## Core Features of AFFINE Compared to Notion and Miro

### Document and Whiteboard Integration

While many editing applications claim to be productivity canvases, AFFINE stands out as one of the few that truly allows you to place any building block on an infinite canvas - from rich text and sticky notes to embedded webpages, multi-view databases, linked pages, and even slides.

Every page offers two distinct views, enabling you to access and edit fully-featured blocks anywhere in any format. This integration provides flexibility that neither Notion nor Miro can match on their own.

### Multimodal AI Assistant

From drafting professional work reports to transforming outlines into expressive presentations, summarizing articles into well-structured mind maps, or even designing and coding prototype applications and websites with just a single prompt - AFFINE AI can do it all.

The AI assistant integrates seamlessly with both document and whiteboard modes, providing contextual help without requiring expensive add-on subscriptions like those offered by competing platforms.

### Local-First and Real-Time Collaboration

AFFINE adheres to the [local-first software principles](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), emphasizing data privacy while still enabling powerful collaboration features. You can completely opt out of using its cloud services and handle synchronization yourself, giving users more choices and flexibility compared to cloud-only solutions like Notion.

### Self-Hosting Capabilities

Users can freely fork and build custom versions of AFFINE or deploy it privately using the methods described in this guide. A plugin ecosystem and third-party modules are coming soon, providing extensibility that closed-source alternatives cannot match.

### Technical Requirements for Self-Hosting AFFINE

AFFINE's self-hosted deployment requires the following components:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis database

However, the [one-click deployment process](https://template.os.sealos.io) with Sealos handles all these requirements automatically, making self-hosting accessible even for non-technical users.

### One-Click Deployment Process

The [Sealos App Store](https://template.os.sealos.io) offers a seamless deployment solution, allowing you to complete the entire setup with just a mouse click.

1. Visit the deployment link:

   <DeployButton deployUrl="https://template.os.sealos.io/deploy?templateName=affine" />

2. Click "Go to Sealos Deployment" to begin deployment

   > If you're a first-time [Sealos](https://sealos.io) user, you'll need to register and log in to a Sealos public cloud account. After logging in, you'll be automatically redirected to the template deployment page.

Once redirected, click "Deploy Application" in the top-right corner to start the deployment process. When deployment completes, simply click "Details" to access the application's details page.
