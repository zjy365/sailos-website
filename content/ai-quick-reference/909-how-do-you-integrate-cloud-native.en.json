  "content": "Cloud-native security tools are security solutions specifically designed for containerization and microservices, such as runtime protection, policy management, and vulnerability scanners. Their integration with existing security systems (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS) is crucial, enabling unified environment monitoring and dynamic threat response, and is applied in multi-cloud deployments to enhance overall security compliance and response efficiency.\n\nCore components include API gateways, data standardization modules, and event adapters. Integration is achieved through standard protocols (e.g., Syslog, REST API), seamlessly flowing cloud-native event data into existing systems. This enhances visibility, automates vulnerability detection and policy enforcement, with impacts including reduced security blind spots, optimized compliance audits, and accelerated incident response times.\n\nImplementation steps: First, assess compatibility and select tools that support open standards, such as Falco or Aqua Security. Second, configure middleware (e.g., plugins or API connectors) to map event data to existing platforms. Finally, test and validate the integration and deploy continuous monitoring. Typical business values include reduced risk exposure, saved operational costs (e.g., automated detection), and ensured end-to-end security of cloud-native applications."
