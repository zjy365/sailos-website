  "content": "Cloud-native workloads refer to dynamic applications based on containers and microservices, emphasizing elasticity and agility. Security strategies are crucial for these workloads, capable of defending against data breaches, malicious attacks, and compliance risks, and are suitable for continuous delivery cloud environments.\n\nCore strategies include zero-trust access control, container image scanning, runtime protection, and Kubernetes network policy isolation. Practical application requires integrating DevSecOps pipelines, automating security testing and policy enforcement, which can significantly reduce the attack surface and improve the overall security posture.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Harden container images, scan for vulnerabilities and sign them; 2. Configure network policies to restrict communication between microservices; 3. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 4. Deploy runtime security monitoring tools. A typical scenario is an e-commerce platform, where business values include enhanced compliance, reduced losses from security incidents, and guaranteed business continuity."
