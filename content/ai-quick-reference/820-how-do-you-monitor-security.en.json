  "content": "Monitoring the security of cloud-native environments requires integrating multiple tools and processes. The core lies in achieving runtime visibility, threat detection, compliance verification, and continuous protection, which is particularly crucial in dynamic, auto-scaling microservices and container environments.\n\nKey practices include: enabling and collecting Kubernetes audit logs at the cluster level; deploying runtime security tools (such as Falco) to monitor abnormal container behavior; using service meshes to implement network policy monitoring; scanning images and configurations in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using Trivy, Checkov); and implementing admission control (e.g., OPA/Gatekeeper). A centralized SIEM/SOAR platform is used to aggregate, correlate, analyze alerts, and automate responses.\n\nSpecific implementation steps: First, establish security baselines (such as CIS benchmarks). Then deploy necessary monitoring and security agents. Next, enforce scanning and policies through CI/CD. Finally, centralize logs and events to the security platform for real-time analysis, alerting, and automated processing. Continuously hardening the image supply chain and configurations is key to success."
