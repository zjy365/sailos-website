Containerized microservice lifecycle management refers to coordinating the entire process of building, deploying, operating, and retiring microservice applications through automated tools. Its importance lies in ensuring the reliability, elastic scaling, and continuous delivery of distributed systems, making it suitable for high-concurrency business scenarios in cloud-native environments.

Core steps include: 1) Building and packaging: Packaging microservice code and dependencies into container images; 2) Deployment and orchestration: Implementing rolling updates and blue-green deployments through platforms like Kubernetes to ensure zero downtime; 3) Monitoring and scaling: Integrating Prometheus monitoring metrics to automatically scale Pod instances based on traffic; 4) Configuration and security: Managing environment variables via ConfigMap/Secrets and regularly scanning for image vulnerabilities; 5) Retirement processing: Cleaning up unused resources. In practice, it needs to be combined with CI/CD pipelines to achieve automation.

The implementation process is: 1. Code submission triggers image building; 2. Helm/Kustomize defines K8s deployment manifests; 3. ArgoCD implements GitOps-style continuous deployment; 4. Managing traffic through Service Mesh. Business values include increasing iteration efficiency by over 50%, reducing operational costs, and enhancing system resilience through health checks and circuit breaker mechanisms.
