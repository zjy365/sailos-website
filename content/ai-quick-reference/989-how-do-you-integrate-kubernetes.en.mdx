Kubernetes security features involve authentication, authorization, and policy control to protect cloud-native infrastructure such as containerized and microservice applications. Their importance lies in ensuring compliance, preventing data breaches, and applying resource isolation in hybrid cloud and DevOps environments.

Core components include RBAC permission management, network policies to restrict communication, Pod security policies to constrain behavior, as well as secrets management and audit logs. By integrating into CI/CD processes and cloud platform tools (such as Istio or Vault), these features automatically enforce security policies, enhancing infrastructure resilience and threat response capabilities.

Implementation steps: Enable RBAC to define roles and bindings; deploy network policies for traffic filtering; use Secrets to manage encrypted sensitive data; integrate audit logs to monitor abnormal activities. Business values include reducing attack risks, accelerating secure deployments, and enhancing compliance confidence.
