IaC tools (such as Terraform or Kubernetes YAML) automate infrastructure management through code, ensuring configuration consistency and version control. For cloud-native load balancers (such as Kubernetes Ingress or service load balancers), they provide high-availability traffic distribution and fault tolerance capabilities, improving efficiency and reducing manual errors in cloud deployments, suitable for microservice architectures and continuous delivery scenarios.

The core components include defining load balancer rules (such as port forwarding and health checks), backend service integration, and security policies. Features like declarative configuration support automated deployment and rollback, based on the principle of infrastructure as code. In practical applications, Terraform is combined with Kubernetes to configure Ingress controllers or load balancer resources, simplifying traffic routing and scaling, and enhancing system reliability and DevOps agility.

Implementation steps: first, select an IaC tool and write configuration files (such as defining service ports and routing rules); second, apply the configuration (using commands like terraform apply); third, test and monitor the performance of the load balancer; finally, update through version control. Typical scenarios include setting up external entry points for Kubernetes services, with business values including accelerating deployment cycles, reducing operational costs, and enhancing security compliance.
