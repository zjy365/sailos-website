  "content": "The core of ensuring application security in the automated deployment process is to seamlessly integrate security protection into the CI/CD pipeline and implement DevSecOps practices. This can proactively prevent vulnerabilities from entering the production environment, meet compliance requirements, and is particularly critical for cloud-native applications, addressing the pain point where traditional security lags behind deployment speed.\n\nIts core measures include: 1) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security checks (e.g., Terraform scanning); 2) Container image scanning; 3) Software Composition Analysis (SCA); 4) Continuous security testing (SAST/DAST); 5) Policy as Code (e.g., using OPA). Automated interception is achieved by connecting security tools (such as Aqua/Trivy/Snyk) via APIs: triggering SCA scans during the code commit phase; blocking high-risk vulnerability images during the build phase; and enforcing K8s security policy verification before deployment.\n\nThe specific implementation steps are: embedding an IaC scanner in the CI process → integrating image scanning into the container build phase → verifying compliance through an admission controller during the deployment phase → implementing runtime protection. This achieves \"\"security left shift\"\" and reduces repair costs by over 90%. A typical scenario is automatically blocking the deployment of images containing CVE vulnerabilities to avoid data leakage risks and meet PCI-DSS requirements."
