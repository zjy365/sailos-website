  "content": "Microservices architecture decomposes applications into independent services that collaborate through network communication. Network partitioning is a common failure in distributed systems where communication between some nodes is interrupted, which may lead to service unavailability or even cascading failures. This issue is crucial as it affects the overall availability of the system, especially in cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes deployments, where fault-tolerance mechanisms are needed to ensure resilience.\n\nCore response principles include the circuit breaker pattern (e.g., Hystrix), which isolates faulty services and automatically interrupts failed calls; timeout settings and retry strategies to limit waiting time; and fallback logic to provide degraded services (e.g., returning cached data). In practical applications, service meshes (e.g., Istio) implement traffic control, enhance monitoring and elasticity, and reduce the risk of business disruptions.\n\nProcessing steps: 1) Implement circuit breakers to monitor service failures and fail fast; 2) Configure timeouts and retry counts to avoid resource exhaustion; 3) Design fallback solutions such as returning default responses. Typical scenarios include displaying error messages instead of blocking the system when the payment service fails. The business value is to ensure high availability, improve user experience, and minimize revenue loss."
