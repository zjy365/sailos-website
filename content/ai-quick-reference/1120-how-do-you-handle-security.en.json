  "content": "Security patch management refers to the process of promptly applying software updates to fix vulnerabilities, which is crucial for multi-cloud deployments (where applications run across multiple clouds such as AWS, Azure, and GCP). It prevents attacks, enhances compliance, and is applied in sensitive fields like finance and e-commerce.\n\nCore components include automation tools (e.g., Azure Update Management), centralized monitoring dashboards, and policy engines, which utilize cloud-native APIs to uniformly handle patches. In practice, it reduces risks, ensures consistency, and improves the security of the entire deployment.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy an integrated platform to scan all clouds. 2. Automate testing and approval processes. 3. Execute phased deployments to minimize disruptions. Business values include reducing leakage risks, maintaining high availability, and supporting compliance audits. A typical scenario is rolling updates of cloud instances."
