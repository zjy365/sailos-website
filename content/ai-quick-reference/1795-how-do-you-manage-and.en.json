  "content": "Governance strategies in IaC workflows involve automating the implementation of organizational rules through policy-as-code to ensure infrastructure deployments meet compliance, security, and consistency requirements. This is crucial for cloud-native environments, as it prevents manual errors, improves resource management efficiency, and applies to CI/CD pipelines such as Kubernetes cluster deployments and multi-cloud management scenarios.\n\nCore components include policy engines (e.g., Open Policy Agent), rules defined in YAML or JSON (e.g., resource naming conventions), and automated validation tools. Key features are reusability and continuous monitoring, supporting various IaC tools like Terraform. In practical applications, through code reviews and policy testing, it reduces violation rates by up to 90% in cloud-native projects and enhances cross-team collaboration.\n\nImplementation steps are as follows: First, define policies using OPA and store them in code repositories; second, integrate with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions for pre-deployment checks; finally, automatically enforce and provide feedback on anomalies. Typical scenarios include validating resource configurations when deploying Kubernetes policies. Business values include reducing risks, shortening delivery cycles, and ensuring audit traceability."
