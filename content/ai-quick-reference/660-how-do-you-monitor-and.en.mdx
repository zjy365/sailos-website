Monitoring and auditing data access in cloud-native environments involves tracking data operation activities to ensure security, compliance, and data integrity. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and supporting regulatory compliance (such as GDPR). Typical applications include monitoring sensitive data access in microservices and storage systems within Kubernetes clusters.

Core components include audit logs (recording access events), metric monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus for collecting performance data), and access control policies (e.g., RBAC). Features are characterized by real-time performance, scalability, and security integration. The principle is based on distributed log aggregation and event tracing mechanisms. In practical applications, it supports the detection of unauthorized access, provides a complete audit trail, significantly enhances the security posture, and reduces compliance risks.

Implementation steps: First, configure the platform's audit logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit); second, integrate a monitoring stack (e.g., Grafana for visualization); third, refine access control (restricting permissions through RBAC); fourth, deploy log analysis (using ELK to parse data); and finally, regularly review reports. A typical scenario is financial data processing. Business values include reducing breach risks, meeting regulatory requirements, and improving operational transparency and trust.
