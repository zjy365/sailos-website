Data replication delay in cloud-native storage systems refers to the time difference between data synchronization from the primary node to replicas, which is a core indicator for ensuring high availability and data consistency. In distributed applications such as database replication and disaster recovery scenarios, excessively high latency may lead to service interruptions or data loss, so monitoring is crucial.

Its core includes network latency, storage throughput, and replication protocol performance. Using tools like Prometheus or Grafana to collect metrics such as ""replication_lag"" can help identify bottlenecks in real time, optimize resource configuration, enhance system resilience, and avoid the risk of data inconsistency.

Implementation steps: Deploy monitoring agents (such as CSI driver or cAdvisor); configure Prometheus to collect latency metrics; set threshold alerts and Grafana dashboards; trigger automated responses such as replica switching. It is typically applied in database cluster maintenance, and its business value includes enhancing service continuity and meeting SLA requirements.
