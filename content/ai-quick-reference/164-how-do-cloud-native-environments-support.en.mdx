Cloud-native environments inherently support multi-cloud application deployment through core technologies such as containerization, microservices, declarative APIs, and dynamic orchestration. Their core value lies in decoupling applications from underlying infrastructure, solving vendor lock-in issues, and providing a foundation for consistently deploying, managing, and scaling applications across different public clouds, private clouds, or edge environments. This meets enterprises' needs for elasticity, high availability, disaster recovery, and cost optimization.

Its core support is reflected in: First, containers (such as Docker) package applications and all their dependencies, ensuring consistent operation across any compliant cloud environment. Second, Kubernetes, as the orchestration standard, unifies the management of containerized applications across multi-clouds through its control plane and workload APIs, providing automated deployment, scaling, service discovery, and load balancing capabilities. Additionally, service meshes (such as Istio) manage cross-cloud microservice communication and security policies. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and cloud-native CI/CD pipelines enable consistent configuration and automated delivery. Abstraction layers (such as Cluster API) simplify multi-cloud cluster management.

Implementing multi-cloud deployment involves microservitizing applications and packaging them in containers; deploying and managing clusters using Kubernetes Federation, Cluster API, or dedicated multi-cloud management platforms; managing cross-cloud service communication through service meshes and unified entry points; adopting persistent storage solutions with multi-cloud support; and utilizing cloud-native monitoring and logging tools for unified observability. The main business values brought by this approach include improving application elasticity and resilience, avoiding single cloud failure risks, enhancing deployment flexibility, optimizing cost-effectiveness, and accelerating global business expansion.
