Access control strategy in multi-cloud systems refers to managing user and resource permissions across multiple cloud platforms through a unified mechanism to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access. Its importance lies in reducing the risk of data leakage, ensuring regulatory compliance (such as GDPR), and optimizing operational efficiency. Application scenarios include integrating services like AWS and Azure in enterprise hybrid cloud deployments to support seamless cross-environment collaboration.

Core components include centralized identity providers (such as SAML or OIDC integration), role-based access control (RBAC), and policy engines. Features involve fine-grained permissions, dynamic policy updates, and audit logs. In practical applications, unified monitoring is achieved through standardized policies, threats are responded to quickly, and configuration errors and impacts on business continuity are significantly reduced.

Implementation steps: First, integrate cross-cloud identity services (for example, using Azure AD or Keycloak); second, define and synchronize RBAC policies; finally, deploy continuous monitoring and automatic audit tools. A typical scenario involves employees securely accessing applications in a multi-cloud environment. Business values include strengthening security posture, improving operational agility, and supporting compliance requirements.
