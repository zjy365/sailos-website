IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is an automated practice that defines infrastructure as code, crucial for implementing DevOps security standards such as consistency and compliance. Its importance lies in reducing human errors, enhancing auditability, and being applied in cloud deployments like Kubernetes environments to accelerate delivery and mitigate risks.

Core components include version control systems (e.g., Git), CI/CD pipelines, security scanning tools (e.g., Terraform's static analysis), and policy-as-code frameworks (e.g., Open Policy Agent). The principle involves coding infrastructure, detecting vulnerabilities through automated scanning, and enforcing policies. In practical applications, security gates are embedded in the CI/CD phase, with impacts including improving security posture, ensuring regulatory compliance, and enhancing infrastructure reliability.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate security scanning tools into the IaC codebase for vulnerability detection. 2. Define and automate security policies as code using compliance benchmarks. 3. Add testing stages (e.g., linting and vulnerability scanning) to the CI/CD pipeline. 4. Implement an automatic approval process that only allows deployments passing inspections. Business values include reducing the risk of security incidents, supporting continuous compliance, and optimizing development efficiency.
