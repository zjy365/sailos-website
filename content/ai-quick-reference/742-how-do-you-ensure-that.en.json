  "content": "Ensuring the security and high performance of cloud-native storage requires balancing data protection, compliance, and low-latency access. This is crucial for running stateful applications such as databases and AI/ML, and serves as the cornerstone of successful cloud-native architectures.\n\nThe core aspects are:\n\n1. Security: Implement encryption for data in transit (e.g., TLS) and at rest, with key management via KMS; control access through RBAC, namespace isolation, and network policies; deploy Pod Security Policies; enable audit logs and conduct regular vulnerability scans.\n\n2. High Performance: Select high-performance storage backends (e.g., local NVMe SSDs, low-latency cloud disks); utilize CSI driver features like topology-aware scheduling to reduce network hops; apply caching strategies and efficient file systems (e.g., XFS/ext4); optimize I/O parallelism and queue depth.\n\n3. Balance: Optimize encryption algorithm performance (e.g., AES-NI hardware acceleration); finely tune QoS policies to prevent resource contention; evaluate the latency impact of compression/deduplication features; deploy distributed monitoring (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) to identify bottlenecks.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Deploy CSI Drivers: Configure storage classes with secure and high-performance features using standard CSI interfaces.\n\n2. Apply Security Configurations: Enforce storage volume encryption (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets encryption), define RBAC rules and network policies to restrict storage access.\n\n3. Performance Tuning: Configure storage class parameters (e.g., IOPS/throughput limits), select appropriate file system options, enable caching (e.g., ReadWriteOnce Pod affinity).\n\n4. Monitoring and Optimization: Continuously track latency, IOPS, and error rates; dynamically adjust storage policies and audit access logs to meet compliance requirements; improve local access efficiency through topological scheduling."
