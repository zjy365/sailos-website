Hybrid cloud expansion elastic handles big data workloads by integrating public and private cloud resources, providing flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and avoiding vendor lock-in. It is suitable for data-intensive applications such as real-time analytics and machine learning to cope with peak demand and security challenges.

Core components include a unified orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes for managing containerized applications), data synchronization mechanisms (such as cross-cloud integration of object storage), and automated scaling strategies based on load monitoring. In practical applications, this enables elastic scaling of big data frameworks like Spark, improving performance and cost efficiency, promoting the deployment of cloud-native technologies, and optimizing data governance and business insights.

Implementation steps include evaluating workload requirements, deploying hybrid infrastructure (e.g., private cloud for processing sensitive data, public cloud for elastic expansion), integrating automation tools (such as HPA autoscaler for monitoring resources), and continuous optimization monitoring. Typical scenarios such as expanding public cloud resources for peak data processing bring business values including elastic scalability, low-latency response, cost reduction (pay-as-you-go only), and accelerated innovation cycles.
