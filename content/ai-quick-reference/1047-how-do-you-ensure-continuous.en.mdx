Ensuring continuous delivery in a multi-cloud environment refers to establishing automated software delivery processes across multiple public clouds, private clouds, or hybrid clouds. Its importance lies in enhancing system resilience, mitigating vendor lock-in risks, optimizing costs and performance, and it is widely applied in scenarios requiring high availability and flexibility such as global financial services and e-commerce.

The core lies in a unified toolchain (e.g., GitLab CI, Argo CD), containerization technology (Docker), and standardized orchestration (Kubernetes), emphasizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cross-cloud monitoring (Prometheus/Loki), and immutable deployments. The key is to achieve environment consistency declarations (via Terraform/Pulumi) and cloud-agnostic workload definitions (e.g., Helm/OCI). This model significantly increases deployment frequency and reliability, simplifying disaster recovery switching processes.

Specific implementation requires分步: first, unify the container runtime and K8s distribution; second, build a shared CI/CD pipeline integrating common environment configurations (via Kustomize/Crossplane); then configure cross-cloud workflows (e.g., Argo CD multi-cluster management); finally, implement unified logging, monitoring, and auditing (Grafana Stack). The value lies in accelerating product iteration, reducing release risks, and flexibly leveraging the advantageous resources of each cloud to optimize costs.
