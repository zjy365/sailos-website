Integrate Kubernetes into the CI/CD pipeline to achieve continuous deployment. By automating application building, testing, and deployment, ensure efficient and reliable software releases. It is suitable for cloud-native environments to accelerate iterations and reduce human errors.

Core components include CI tools (such as Jenkins) to execute image building and testing. In the CD phase, Kubernetes deployment definitions (such as YAML files or Helm charts) are used to automatically orchestrate containerized applications, supporting strategies like blue-green deployment or canary release, thereby improving system resilience, seamless updates, and cluster management efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Configure the CI pipeline to build Docker images and push them to the repository. 2. Define Kubernetes deployment files and integrate CD tools (such as Argo CD). 3. Automatically trigger deployment, monitor status, and support rollbacks. Typical scenarios achieve zero-downtime updates. Business values include shortening release cycles, improving reliability, and accelerating market response.
