  "content": "The API Gateway is a key component in the microservices architecture, serving as a unified entry point for clients to access backend services. Its importance lies in simplifying the complexity of client calls, providing centralized security, traffic management, and monitoring capabilities, making it suitable for microservice decoupling, multi-protocol support, and high-concurrency scenarios.\n\nThe core functions of an API Gateway include: request routing and aggregation (distributing client requests to corresponding microservices and supporting the merging of multiple service responses), protocol conversion (e.g., HTTP to gRPC), unified authentication and authorization, traffic control (rate limiting and circuit breaking), logging, and monitoring. It centralizes service governance capabilities, significantly reduces coupling between microservices, and enhances system security as a barrier for north-south traffic.\n\nThe API Gateway significantly improves development efficiency (reducing client adaptation work) and operational effectiveness (unified policy management). Its business value lies in ensuring API security and compliance through centralized control, optimizing client experience (reducing latency via request aggregation), enhancing system resilience (circuit breaking protection), and supporting advanced features such as canary releases, ultimately improving the maintainability and scalability of the overall architecture. Practice has shown that it can reduce microservice integration costs by 40%."
