Cross-cloud platform microservice configuration management refers to the centralized control and maintenance of microservice configurations (such as environment variables and connection information) in a multi-cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, or private clouds). This concept is crucial as it ensures consistency, reduces deployment errors, and enhances service portability, making it suitable for hybrid cloud and global deployment scenarios.

Core components include configuration storage (e.g., Git repositories or HashiCorp Consul), and management tools (e.g., Spring Cloud Config) that support dynamic updates, version control, and encryption. By externalizing configurations, it improves operational efficiency, reduces the risk of configuration drift, and supports disaster recovery and multi-cloud elasticity, impacting areas such as DevOps automation and CI/CD pipeline optimization.

Implementation steps: Adopt a unified configuration service to integrate various cloud APIs, store configurations in a version control system, and use automation tools for synchronous updates. A typical scenario is deploying consistent applications across multiple clouds via Kubernetes Secrets. Business values include cost reduction (through resource sharing), improved agility (accelerated iterations), and enhanced scalability (simplified multi-cloud migration).
