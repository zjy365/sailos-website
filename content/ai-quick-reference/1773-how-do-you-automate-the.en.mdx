Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure management using executable code, with the core objectives of reducing manual operations, ensuring consistency, and improving efficiency. When deploying network devices such as routers and switches, IaC minimizes configuration errors through version control, making it suitable for scenarios like cloud environments and enterprise data centers.

Key features include defining network configuration templates using declarative tools like Terraform, supporting automation scripts, and state management. The core principle is to drive the deployment process through code, abstracting network device settings into reusable modules. In practical applications, it automates network topology configuration, enabling rapid scaling and compliance checks, thus promoting DevOps practices and modernizing network operations.

Implementation steps: 1) Select appropriate IaC tools (e.g., Terraform), 2) Write code templates to define parameters such as device IP addresses and routing rules, 3) Integrate CI/CD pipelines to trigger automated deployments. Typical use cases include automatically configuring VLANs or firewall rules. Business values include shortening deployment cycles, reducing costs by up to 50%, and enhancing system reliability and security compliance.
