Microservices are independent, deployable components in distributed systems, while security monitoring continuously detects potential threats to protect the system. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and ensuring compliance, with application scenarios such as API security protection and authentication.

Core components include log aggregation (e.g., using Fluentd), real-time threat detection (e.g., intrusion detection systems), and access control policies. Features involve automated alerts and observability integration. In practical applications, deploying Prometheus for monitoring metrics and Istio service mesh significantly enhances security resilience and agility.

Implementation steps: First, deploy a service mesh to manage communications; second, configure centralized monitoring tools such as the ELK stack; finally, implement automated response mechanisms. Typical business values include reducing vulnerability risks and ensuring business continuity.
