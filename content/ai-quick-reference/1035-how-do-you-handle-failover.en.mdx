In multi-cloud deployments, failover between cloud providers refers to the ability to automatically or manually switch traffic and workloads to other available cloud platforms when services on a cloud platform are disrupted. This is crucial as it ensures business continuity, high availability, and mitigates the risk of vendor lock-in, making it suitable for critical application scenarios requiring extreme business resilience.

The core of implementing such failover lies in designing decoupling, global traffic management, and automated detection. Key components include: multi-cluster management platforms (such as Kubernetes Fleet Manager) to uniformly monitor the status of cloud clusters; global load balancers (such as Global Server Load Balancing, GSLB, provided by cloud service providers or third parties) to intelligently route user requests based on predefined policies (geographic location, latency, health status); declarative configuration and automated orchestration tools (such as IaC) to ensure consistent deployment across cloud environments; and active health checks to continuously probe the availability of service endpoints across clouds. The impact is to achieve application resilience across cloud layers.

The main steps to implement multi-cloud failover are: 1) Design the application to be stateless or with state synchronization, enabling migration between clouds; 2) Deploy application replicas on each cloud platform; 3) Configure GSLB services to bind public endpoints of all cloud deployments; 4) Set up failover policies for GSLB to automatically point DNS resolution to healthy clouds when health checks for an endpoint on a cloud fail; 5) Integrate with an alert system to perform automated switching or notify manual intervention. Typical business values include minimizing downtime, ensuring user experience, and enhancing disaster recovery capabilities.
