The key challenge in setting up CI/CD for microservices architecture lies in managing complexity: the coordination difficulties brought by building, testing, and deploying numerous independent services, while ensuring environmental consistency and rapid feedback loops. Its importance lies in guaranteeing continuous delivery capabilities and system reliability, which is a core practice for agile iteration of cloud-native applications.

Common challenges include: Environmental consistency: ensuring consistent configurations of all services across development, testing, and production environments; Complexity of dependency management: dependencies between microservices and version coordination increase the complexity of building and deployment; Testing fragmentation: unit testing is easy, but end-to-end testing requires cross-service coordination; Build pipeline explosion: numerous independent repositories lead to a surge in pipelines and management burden; Difficulty in deployment orchestration: blue-green/canary releases are more complex in multi-service scenarios.

Coping strategies emphasize standardization and automation: adopting common CI/CD templates and unified orchestration tools to manage multiple pipelines; using containers and Kubernetes to ensure environmental consistency; implementing infrastructure as code; establishing sound service monitoring and alerting; adopting progressive delivery technologies to reduce release risks. Successful implementation can significantly improve delivery speed, system stability, and team efficiency.
