  "content": "Cloud-native applications are built based on microservice architecture and container technology. Disaster recovery capability ensures that the system can quickly resume services after a disaster, which is crucial for ensuring business continuity and minimizing losses, and is applicable to high-availability scenarios such as finance and e-commerce.\n\nCore components include redundancy design such as multi-region deployment, automatic failover mechanisms, and data persistence strategies such as snapshot backups. In practical applications, geographical redundancy is achieved through Kubernetes cluster management, combined with service mesh for traffic switching, which enhances system resilience and business sustainability, with impacts including improved compliance and user trust.\n\nImplementation steps include: designing a multi-region architecture, configuring automatic backups, deploying monitoring and alert systems, and conducting regular disaster testing. Typical scenarios involve simulating failure recovery in cloud environments. The business value lies in reducing downtime risks, ensuring rapid response and service availability, supporting critical business growth and regulatory compliance."
