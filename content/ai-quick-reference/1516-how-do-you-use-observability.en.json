  "content": "Observability is the ability to monitor application behavior by collecting and analyzing system data, which is crucial for enhancing security. It enables early detection of potential threats such as unusual logins or data breaches. Application scenarios include real-time security monitoring in cloud-native environments and distributed systems like Kubernetes.\n\nThe core components include logging, metrics tracking, and alert systems, characterized by real-time data processing and anomaly detection principles. These tools strengthen protection by identifying patterns such as API abuse or attack attempts, with practical impacts of shortening security response time and reducing risk exposure.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy security monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM), configure security-related logs and tracking sources, and set up behavior-based alert rules. Typical scenarios cover user authentication auditing and network traffic analysis, with business values involving accelerating threat处置, reducing vulnerability costs, and enhancing compliance."
