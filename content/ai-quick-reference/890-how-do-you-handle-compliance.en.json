  "content": "In regulated industries (such as finance or healthcare), compliance for cloud-native applications refers to adhering to regulations (such as GDPR or HIPAA), and security involves protecting data and systems from threats, which is crucial for avoiding legal penalties, data breaches, and loss of business trust. Application scenarios include payment systems or medical record platforms that handle sensitive data.\n\nCore components include compliance frameworks (such as NIST CSF), security controls (such as network policies and secrets management), and policy-as-code (such as Kubernetes Pod Security Policies or OPA), based on the principles of zero trust and defense in depth. In practical applications, integrating security shifting left (such as CI/CD pipeline scanning) and automated auditing tools (such as Falco) can improve detection efficiency, with impacts including reducing human errors and accelerating compliance proof.\n\nProcessing steps: first, conduct risk analysis and select standards (such as CIS benchmarks), then implement policy automation and encryption (such as TLS/Secrets), and finally continuously monitor logs and run compliance tests. The business value is reducing audit costs and enabling rapid iteration."
