In a multi-tenant environment, multiple tenants share cloud infrastructure, and cloud-native application workloads (such as containerized services and microservices) are vulnerable to security threats. Protecting these workloads is crucial to ensure tenant isolation, data privacy, and compliance, applicable to public clouds, SaaS platforms, and enterprise shared cluster scenarios.

Core protection mechanisms include network isolation (using Calico or Cilium network policies), identity access control (such as Kubernetes RBAC and OpenID Connect), resource quota limitations (to prevent resource exhaustion), and security scanning tools (such as Falco or Twistlock). These components implement the principle of least privilege and fine-grained isolation, reduce the attack surface, while supporting auditing and monitoring, and are practically applied in Kubernetes clusters to improve operational security and tenant satisfaction.

Implementation steps: 1. Create tenant resource isolation using namespaces. 2. Configure network policies to control incoming/outgoing traffic. 3. Apply RBAC to define role permissions. 4. Deploy security scanning and log monitoring tools. Typical scenarios include cloud platform deployment and microservice architecture, with business values including reducing the risk of data leakage, complying with regulations such as GDPR, and enhancing customer trust.
