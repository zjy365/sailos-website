Setting up monitoring for third-party services involves observing their operational status and ensuring collaborative reliability with cloud-native applications. The importance lies in safeguarding system availability and performance, as well as preventing fault propagation; common scenarios include the integration of payment gateways or SaaS services.

The core components include metric exporters (such as Prometheus exporters), service discovery mechanisms, and alerting rules. The principle is based on collecting key metrics like response time and error rate; in practical applications, automatic integration through Kubernetes Operators or OpenTelemetry improves fault response efficiency.

Implementation steps: Define service SLOs; deploy exporters or use APIs to collect data; visualize on monitoring platforms (such as Grafana); set threshold alerts. Typical scenarios include database monitoring; the business value is reducing downtime risks and ensuring SLA compliance.
