Integrating CI/CD tools with IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is key to achieving continuous configuration through automated processes, ensuring infrastructure changes are repeatable, auditable, and scalable. Its importance lies in reducing manual operation errors and improving efficiency, applicable in cloud-native environments and DevOps practices, such as automatically deploying cloud resources to support application iterations.

The core components include: CI pipelines (e.g., Jenkins or GitLab CI), versioned IaC code (e.g., Terraform or Ansible), and automated triggering mechanisms. In principle, CI monitors changes in the code repository and executes IaC tools to plan and apply configuration updates. In practical applications, after developers submit IaC changes, the pipeline automatically tests and deploys to target environments (e.g., testing or production), significantly improving configuration consistency and deployment speed.

Implementation steps: 1. Manage IaC code in Git. 2. Configure CI/CD tools to add stages: initialize IaC tools, run plan and apply commands. 3. Integrate automated testing and code reviews. 4. Trigger deployment to the specified environment. Typical scenarios include automatically configuring servers when code is committed. Business values include accelerating delivery, reducing operational costs, and improving system reliability.
