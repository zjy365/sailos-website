  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is a method of defining and managing cloud resources through code, enabling automation and version control of configurations. Its importance lies in eliminating manual errors, improving consistency and repeatability, and reducing operational costs. Application scenarios include the creation, update, and destruction of cloud servers, networks, and storage, suitable for DevOps processes and cloud-native environment deployments.\n\nCore components include tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, which use declarative languages to describe resources; features encompass version control, reusable templates, and test-driven principles. Configuration tasks are executed through automated scripts, combined with CI/CD integration to achieve continuous deployment. In practical applications, IaC promotes agile development, ensures environmental consistency, accelerates multi-cloud resource management, and significantly improves efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: Select an IaC tool; write infrastructure definition code; store in version control; integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment; test and apply to the target environment. A typical scenario is the automatic creation of cloud virtual machine clusters. Business values include shortening time-to-market, reducing human risks, enhancing scalability and high availability, and driving operational modernization."
