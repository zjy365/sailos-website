  "content": "Microservices is an application architectural style that breaks down complex systems into small, independently deployable services. Its importance lies in supporting agile development and elastic scalability of large-scale applications, suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce platforms and financial systems, simplifying maintenance and improving overall reliability.\n\nCore features include loose coupling of services, diversity of technology stacks, and independent deployment pipelines. Advantages such as on-demand resource scaling, rapid iterative updates, and local isolation of failures effectively prevent overall downtime. In practical applications, multiple development teams can work in parallel to accelerate the release cycle; it promotes the cloud-native ecosystem, drives containerization and Kubernetes management to optimize deployment efficiency and resource utilization.\n\nIn application, microservices enable dynamic scaling and continuous delivery, with the value of significantly shortening time-to-market, reducing operational costs, and enhancing system resilience to support business innovation and high availability requirements."
