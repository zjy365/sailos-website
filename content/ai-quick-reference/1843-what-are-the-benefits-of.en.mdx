Cloud-native development builds agile applications through containerization, microservices, and DevOps principles. Managed services are services managed by cloud providers, such as databases, computing, or message queues. Their importance lies in eliminating the burden of infrastructure operations and maintenance, allowing teams to focus on innovation; application scenarios include highly available, scalable systems such as e-commerce platforms or real-time applications.

The core of managed services includes managed Kubernetes, object storage, and function computing, characterized by automatic scaling, high availability, and built-in monitoring. With providers handling infrastructure management, developers integrate services to simplify deployment and maintenance. Practical applications include handling the data layer in microservice architectures to reduce manual configuration; the impact is a 20-50% improvement in development efficiency, ensuring application reliability and scalability.

The benefits of using managed services include reduced operational complexity, accelerated time-to-market, enhanced security, and cost optimization. Business value is reflected in flexible resource scheduling and improved innovation, with typical scenarios such as AI model deployment enabling automatic scaling and disaster recovery.
