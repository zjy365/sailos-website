  "content": "In cloud-native environments, data lifecycle management refers to the automated, policy-driven control of the entire process of data from creation, processing, storage, archiving to destruction. Its importance lies in addressing the data fragmentation challenges brought by microservice architectures and elastic scaling, ensuring cost-effectiveness, compliance, and high availability, applicable to scenarios such as databases, logs, and user-generated content.\n\nThe core includes policy definition (such as retention time, access frequency levels), automated control tools (such as Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims PVC, Storage Classes StorageClass, Custom Resource Definitions CRD), and unified data services (object storage/database as a service). Decoupling policies from storage infrastructure through declarative APIs, Operators automatically enforce policy adjustments (such as moving hot data to cold storage). Practical applications include: automatically transferring S3 objects to Glacier based on access patterns to reduce costs; automatically cleaning up pipeline intermediate data after task completion; protecting critical data points through CSI snapshots.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Policy formulation: define data classification (hot/warm/cold), retention policies, and compliance requirements; 2) System configuration: use StorageClass to define tiered storage, deploy lifecycle Operators (such as Velero, StoragesOS, or cloud service logic); 3) Integrated monitoring: track data status through Prometheus/Grafana to trigger policy execution. Typical business value: 60% optimization of storage costs, 30% acceleration of data processing, and meeting automatic compliance audits such as GDPR."
