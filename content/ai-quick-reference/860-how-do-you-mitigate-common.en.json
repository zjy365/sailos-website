  "content": "Cloud-native application vulnerabilities refer to security weaknesses in container images, configurations, and API exposures, which may lead to data breaches or service disruptions. Their mitigation is crucial for ensuring business continuity and compliance, and they are widely applied in microservices and Kubernetes deployment scenarios.\n\nCore strategies include image scanning to detect malicious code, implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict permissions, and network policies to isolate container communications. These practices reduce the attack surface by integrating security tools, enhance the overall resilience of the cloud environment, and promote DevSecOps processes.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Integrate container image scanning into CI/CD pipelines. 2. Configure access control based on the principle of least privilege. 3. Use Kubernetes network policies to achieve service isolation. 4. Regularly audit and update security policies. Typical scenarios include automated vulnerability management, with the value of reducing security risks and ensuring compliance such as GDPR."
