Microservices architecture decomposes applications into small, independently deployable service units that achieve loose coupling through API communication. Its importance lies in enhancing resilience and maintainability, applied in cloud computing environments for high-availability systems such as e-commerce or financial platforms, ensuring partial failures do not affect overall operation.

Core features include service autonomy and independent deployment, achieving fault isolation through containerization technology to avoid single points of failure. Core principles such as decentralized governance and resilience patterns (e.g., circuit breakers) reduce cascading failures through automatic recovery mechanisms. Practical impacts are reflected in cloud-native scenarios, where tools like Kubernetes provide auto-scaling and monitoring to improve overall system stability.

Steps to enhance resilience: design independent service boundaries and integrate resilience patterns (e.g., timeout and retry); deploy automatic fault detection and recovery tools (e.g., health checks); configure container orchestration engines to achieve seamless restart. Typical business values are reducing downtime and maintenance costs, ensuring service continuity and seamless user experience during failures.
