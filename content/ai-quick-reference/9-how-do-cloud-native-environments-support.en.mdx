The cloud-native environment is an application paradigm built and run on cloud computing, utilizing containerization, microservices, and automation tools. It is crucial for microservice development, supporting highly available and scalable applications through service decoupling and dynamic management, typically applied in agile iteration scenarios such as e-commerce or financial systems.

Its core includes container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes for automated deployment and scaling), service mesh (Istio providing service discovery and traffic control), and DevOps pipelines. These components enable independent lifecycle management of microservices, fault isolation, and continuous delivery, significantly improving development efficiency and reducing operational complexity.

Supporting steps: Developers containerize individual microservices and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster; integrate service mesh to optimize communication; automate CI/CD to achieve rapid iteration. A typical example is banking systems, which benefit from agile releases, cost savings, and business resilience.
