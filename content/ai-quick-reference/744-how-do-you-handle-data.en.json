  "content": "Data migration is the process of transferring data from a source system (such as an on-premises database) to a target system (such as a cloud environment). When migrating to a cloud-native architecture, its importance lies in ensuring data consistency, integrity, and business continuity to avoid application disruptions. Application scenarios involve enterprises migrating to cloud platforms to enhance elasticity, scalability, and cost efficiency, supporting containerized microservices.\n\nThe core components include data assessment, migration tool selection (e.g., AWS DMS or Azure SQL Migration), migration execution, and validation. Features encompass data transformation, security encryption, and performance optimization. In practical applications, adopting cloud-native solutions such as volume snapshots or Kubernetes StatefulSets enables persistent state data in containerized environments, significantly improving system reliability and maintainability while reducing migration risks.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1. Analyzing source data and target cloud resource requirements; 2. Selecting migration services such as database replication tools; 3. Testing migration in a sandbox environment; 4. Executing and monitoring the process; 5. Validating data accuracy and application integration. A typical scenario is migrating an on-premises SQL Server to a cloud database (e.g., AWS RDS). The business value lies in reducing costs, enhancing scalability, supporting agile cloud-native deployments, and strengthening business competitiveness."
