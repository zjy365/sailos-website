Manual deployment refers to the process of manually executing release operations, involving direct intervention tasks such as configuration and testing. It is important for providing flexibility and control, suitable for debugging or small-scale environments. Automated deployment, on the other hand, achieves unattended continuous release through tools (such as CI/CD pipelines), improving efficiency and reliability, and is widely used in cloud-native and frequently iterative scenarios.

Its core features include: manual deployment relies on manual steps, which are error-prone and time-consuming; automated deployment integrates scripts and workflows to ensure consistency and scalability. In terms of practical impact, automated deployment has promoted the DevOps culture, reduced failures, accelerated delivery cycles, and facilitated agile development.

In terms of application value, manual deployment is suitable for highly customized scenarios; automated deployment significantly improves speed, reduces risks, supports business continuity and rapid market response, bringing cost savings and innovation advantages to enterprises.
