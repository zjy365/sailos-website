Handling security vulnerabilities in a multi-cloud environment refers to identifying and fixing security flaws across multiple cloud services such as AWS and Azure. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and service disruptions, ensuring compliance and business continuity, and it is applicable to cloud-native application deployment scenarios.

Core methods include unified policy management, automated scanning tools (such as CSPM and vulnerability assessors), and zero-trust architecture principles to achieve consistent cross-cloud risk detection and response. In practical applications, integrating Kubernetes-native security tools (such as Falco) enhances container runtime protection, improves overall security resilience, and reduces the attack surface.

Implementation steps: 1. Establish a centralized monitoring and alert system; 2. Automate regular vulnerability scanning and assessment; 3. Promptly fix and apply patches; 4. Conduct continuous audits and compliance checks. The business value lies in reducing incident response costs, ensuring business availability, and meeting regulatory requirements.
