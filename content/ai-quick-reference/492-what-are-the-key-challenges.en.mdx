Microservices are a distributed architectural style that decomposes applications into small, independent services, enhancing development agility and deployment efficiency. They are suitable for cloud-native environments such as containerized systems managed by Kubernetes. Their importance lies in supporting high scalability and resilience, making them widely used in high-concurrency scenarios like e-commerce and IoT.

The core challenges in testing microservices include dependency management (such as inter-service API calls and mocking), asynchronous communication testing, maintenance of environmental consistency (such as differences between local and production environments), and fault handling in distributed systems. These characteristics increase testing complexity and affect test coverage and reliability. In practical applications, contract testing frameworks (e.g., Pact) and automated CI/CD pipelines need to be adopted to address the fragmented nature of microservices and ensure system robustness.

The main challenge is managing the complexity of inter-service interactions. By identifying these difficulties, effective testing strategies (such as end-to-end and chaos testing) can be implemented to reduce production failure rates, improve business continuity, and enhance deployment speed.
