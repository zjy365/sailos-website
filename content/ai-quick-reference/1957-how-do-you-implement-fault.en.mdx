In cloud-native architecture, fault tolerance refers to the system's ability to maintain operation during failures, while elasticity refers to the system's ability to adapt to load changes and recover quickly; both are crucial for high availability and performance improvement, and are widely used in critical scenarios such as financial transactions and e-commerce platforms.

The core of implementation includes microservice design to isolate faults, service meshes (such as Istio) to handle retries and circuit breakers, and container orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes) to provide automatic restart and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). In practice, Kubernetes health probes (Liveness/Readiness) are used to monitor instance status, combined with redundant deployment, effectively reducing downtime and optimizing resource utilization.

Specific implementation steps: 1. Architect the design as microservices. 2. Deploy applications in Kubernetes, configure probes and auto-scaling rules. 3. Integrate service mesh to manage communication fault tolerance. A typical scenario is handling sudden traffic peaks, and the business value lies in improving user experience, ensuring service continuity, and achieving cost savings through on-demand resource allocation.
