  "content": "Cloud-native development is based on containerization and Kubernetes orchestration, enabling dynamic scaling and real-time management of applications, with a core focus on ensuring high availability and low latency. Its importance lies in enhancing agile deployment and reliability, making it suitable for scenarios requiring instant responses such as e-commerce and IoT.\n\nCore components include Kubernetes, which provides automated deployment and self-healing capabilities; service meshes like Istio for managing traffic and fault tolerance; and Prometheus for real-time monitoring metrics. Features encompass declarative configuration and auto-scaling, enabling zero-downtime updates and resource optimization, significantly improving system resilience and supporting efficient operation and maintenance under microservice architectures.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Containerize applications to encapsulate components; 2. Deploy to Kubernetes clusters; 3. Configure health checks and horizontal auto-scaling; 4. Integrate real-time monitoring and logging. Typical applications include streaming media or financial transaction systems, with business values including reduced service disruptions, improved user response speed, and lower operational costs."
