An automated deployment pipeline uses a toolchain to automate the build, testing, and release processes of mobile applications. It accelerates iterations and reduces errors by eliminating manual intervention, suitable for mobile development scenarios requiring frequent updates such as A/B testing and hotfixes.

Core components include version control systems (e.g., Git), continuous integration services (e.g., Jenkins or GitHub Actions), build tools (e.g., Gradle or Fastlane), and testing frameworks. It features an event-triggered mechanism (e.g., code commits) and operates on the principle of serializing workflows from code inspection to production deployment. In practical applications, it seamlessly integrates with cloud platforms like App Store Connect or Firebase, enhancing release frequency and quality.

Implementation steps: 1) Integrate a Git repository to synchronize code changes. 2) Configure a CI server to trigger automated builds and tests. 3) Use scripts to deploy to a testing environment for verification. 4) Automatically release to application stores. Business values include reducing time-to-market by over 50%, lowering deployment risks, and improving development team productivity.
