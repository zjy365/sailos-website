Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method for automating the management of IT infrastructure through code, ensuring configuration consistency and repeatability. Its importance lies in reducing manual errors, accelerating the deployment process, and ensuring consistency across multiple environments. Key application scenarios include the configuration of development, testing, and production environments for cloud services (such as AWS or Azure), with standardized management implemented using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

The core components of IaC include declarative scripts (such as YAML or HCL files) that define infrastructure states, version control (such as Git) to track changes, and modular design to support reusable components. Features emphasize idempotency and auditability to ensure the same result with each deployment. In practical applications, it enables environment isolation (such as distinguishing environment parameters through variables), significantly improving the agility and reliability of cloud-native and DevOps workflows, and reducing the risk of configuration drift.

Steps to implement IaC for configuring a specific environment: 1. Define environment variables (such as region or size). 2. Write scripts using tools (Ansible or Kubernetes manifests). 3. Integrate CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment. Typical scenarios support blue-green deployments or rollbacks. Business value includes accelerated delivery (reduced from hours to minutes), reduced operational costs, and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities.
