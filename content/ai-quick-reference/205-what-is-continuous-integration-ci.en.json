  "content": "Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository and verify the integration through automated builds and tests to ensure code quality. It is crucial in agile and DevOps environments, enabling early error detection, reducing integration risks, and is applied in cloud-native application development to enhance efficiency and reliability.\n\nThe core components of CI include source code management (such as Git), CI servers (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD), and automated test suites. Its principle is to use tools to automate the build, test, and feedback loops, achieving seamless integration. In containerized environments like Kubernetes, CI is used to build Docker images and conduct tests, significantly accelerating the deployment pipeline, with impacts including improved team collaboration and shortened release cycles.\n\nThe application of CI is closely related to automated deployment: it provides validated and reliable code for Continuous Deployment (CD), triggering deployment to testing or production environments through automated pipelines. The business value lies in reducing manual errors, increasing release speed, and ensuring software stability, enabling end-to-end automation in modern IT operations."
