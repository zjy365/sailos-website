Resource allocation management for CI/CD pipelines involves the reasonable distribution of computing resources such as CPU and memory for the build, test, and deployment stages. Its importance lies in ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of the pipeline, avoiding timeout failures and resource waste, and it is applied in DevOps processes to accelerate software delivery.

The core components include resource quota setting, auto-scaling mechanisms, and priority scheduling strategies. The principle is to perform dynamic scheduling with tools like Kubernetes or Jenkins to optimize load balancing. Practical applications include reducing execution latency, increasing deployment frequency, significantly lowering infrastructure costs, and enhancing system stability.

Implementation steps: Set resource requests and limits, monitor usage metrics, and apply auto-scaling tools such as Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. A typical scenario is in high-concurrency deployment environments, with business values including shortening release cycles to the minute level, reducing operational overhead, and improving team productivity.
