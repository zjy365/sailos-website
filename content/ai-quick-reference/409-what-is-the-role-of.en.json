  "content": "API is an interface for communication between services, defining interaction protocols in microservice architectures to ensure service independence. Its importance lies in decoupling components, enabling horizontal scalability and maintainability; application scenarios include service integration and request routing in cloud-native systems, such as API gateways managing microservice traffic.\n\nCore components include endpoints, protocols (e.g., REST/HTTP), and authentication mechanisms; features are loose coupling, version control, and high availability. In practical applications, API gateways provide a unified entry and load distribution; impacts include improving development efficiency, reducing system dependencies, and supporting automated orchestration through service discovery in Kubernetes environments.\n\nApplication value lies in promoting modular collaboration: services interoperate via APIs, simplifying testing and deployment; values include accelerating business iteration, enhancing resilience, and enabling seamless scaling and monitoring on containerized platforms."
