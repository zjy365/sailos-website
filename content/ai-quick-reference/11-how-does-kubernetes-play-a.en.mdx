Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used to automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications. In cloud-native development environments, it serves as core infrastructure, supporting microservices and continuous delivery, ensuring high availability, scalability, and resilience of applications. Its importance lies in providing a consistent development environment, accelerating agile iterations, and being suitable for scenarios such as microservice decomposition and multi-cluster management.

Core components include Pods, Services, Controllers, and Kubelet, with features like auto-scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing. Through declarative configuration to manage resources, Kubernetes simplifies cluster operations and实现了负载均衡和服务发现. In practical applications, it integrates toolchains such as Prometheus and Istio, improving operational efficiency and application reliability, and driving the standardization and development of the cloud-native ecosystem.

As an application platform layer, Kubernetes abstracts infrastructure details, allowing developers to focus on business logic. Application values include accelerating development cycles, optimizing resource utilization, reducing complexity and costs, and enhancing an organization's competitiveness in rapid deployment and elastic scaling.
