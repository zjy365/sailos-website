  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, log retention refers to the ability to store and access application log data for an extended period to ensure compliance, which involves adhering to regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Its importance lies in providing an audit trail, preventing data loss, and reducing legal risks. Application scenarios include Kubernetes deployments in financial services or healthcare, where logs serve as the foundation for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\nThe core components include log collectors (such as Fluentd or Fluent Bit), persistent storage (such as Amazon S3 or Elasticsearch), and automated policy engines (defining retention periods and encryption). Features include scalability, automated rotation, and security controls. Practical applications support multi-tenant isolation and real-time analysis through a unified platform, improving operational efficiency and reducing compliance costs.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy log agents (e.g., using DaemonSet in Kubernetes). 2. Configure storage backends (set retention policies such as time-based or size-based deletion). 3. Add security measures (enable TLS encryption and RBAC). 4. Regularly audit policy effectiveness. A typical scenario is microservice log archiving, with business values of ensuring regulatory compliance and enhancing system reliability."
