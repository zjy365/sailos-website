The cloud-native environment serves as the core platform for orchestrating, managing, and scaling Docker containers, addressing the limitations of the standalone Docker engine in distributed application deployment, operation and maintenance, and elastic scaling. It is crucial in scenarios such as microservices architecture, continuous delivery, elastic scaling, and hybrid cloud deployment.

Kubernetes is the core orchestrator for cloud-native environments, managing the container lifecycle through integration with Docker runtimes like containerd. Its core components include declarative APIs for defining desired states, controllers for real-time state matching, service discovery and load balancing, and integration with storage/network plugins. Service Mesh further enhances the governance of inter-service communication, enabling seamless traffic management, security, and observability.

Cloud-native environments support Docker containers through the following key operations: using Deployments to declare Pod replica counts and update strategies, implementing external exposure and internal discovery via Services and Ingress, managing application configurations with ConfigMaps/Secrets, automatically scaling based on metrics using Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, and integrating logging/monitoring tools to achieve full-stack observability, significantly improving management efficiency and application resilience.
