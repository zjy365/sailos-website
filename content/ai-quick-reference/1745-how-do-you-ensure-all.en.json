  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of configuring and managing infrastructure through code. Its importance lies in ensuring consistency, reducing human errors, and supporting automated deployment. It applies to cloud environments such as AWS or Azure, enabling efficient resource management and compliance auditing.\n\nThe core components of IaC include declarative code files (e.g., Terraform or Ansible), version control systems (e.g., Git), and CI/CD pipelines. Features include repeatability, version tracking, and automated testing. The principle is to define infrastructure configurations as code. In practical applications, it enforces security policies and resource optimization, such as managing clusters in Kubernetes environments to enhance resilience and cost efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define best practices as code templates; 2. Integrate security checking tools (e.g., OPA); 3. Automate deployment with validation and testing through CI/CD; 4. Continuously monitor and iteratively update. Typical scenarios include consistent deployment across multiple environments. The business value is reducing risks, optimizing costs, and accelerating innovation."
