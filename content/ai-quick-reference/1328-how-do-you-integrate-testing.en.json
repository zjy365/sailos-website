  "content": "CI/CD pipelines automate software building, testing, and deployment processes, with testing frameworks like JUnit or Selenium performing unit, integration, or end-to-end tests. Integration testing is crucial as it ensures code quality, reduces defects, and accelerates feedback, widely used in agile and DevOps environments to support reliable releases.\n\nCore components include configuring testing stages in CI tools (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI) to trigger tests upon code commits; the principle is that automated verification prevents issues from entering production. In practical applications, integration increases test coverage, reduces manual intervention, and impacts areas such as lowering deployment risks and enhancing team collaboration efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps are: 1. Add test commands in the CI configuration file (e.g., run \"\"npm test\"\"). 2. Define trigger points (e.g., every code push). 3. Analyze test reports and stop the pipeline when build errors occur due to failures. 4. A typical scenario is verification after new feature commits, with business value in shortening release cycles and saving costs."
