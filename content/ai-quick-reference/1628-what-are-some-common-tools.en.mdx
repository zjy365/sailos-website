Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of defining and managing infrastructure through scripts or configuration files, ensuring repeatability, consistency, and scalability. It is crucial in cloud automation and applicable to cloud resource deployment, environment standardization, and DevOps workflows.

Its core includes declarative or imperative configurations, version control integration, and automated orchestration. Tools automatically perform infrastructure lifecycle management, reducing manual errors and supporting multi-cloud strategies. In practical applications, it drives efficient resource provisioning, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and compliance governance.

Commonly used tools include Terraform (cross-cloud orchestration), AWS CloudFormation (AWS-specific), and Pulumi (code flexibility). These tools enable automated infrastructure, reduce operational costs, and provide versioned collaboration and auditable tracking capabilities.
