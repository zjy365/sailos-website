Cloud-native environments are based on containerization (e.g., Docker) and Kubernetes orchestration technology, supporting the automation, elastic scaling, and self-healing requirements for managing microservices architectures. Their importance lies in enhancing application scalability and reliability, making them suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce and financial services to ensure continuous service delivery.

The core components include service meshes (e.g., Istio) for communication management, configuration management, and observability tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana). Key features involve dynamic load balancing and self-healing mechanisms. Practical applications simplify deployment pipelines, optimize monitoring and fault recovery, significantly reducing operational burdens and improving development efficiency.

Implementation steps: containerize microservices, deploy them to Kubernetes, integrate CI/CD pipelines, and configure auto-scaling policies and monitoring alerts. Typical scenarios include elastically scaling services during traffic peaks or enabling secure communication through service meshes. Business values include accelerating release cycles, enhancing system reliability, and reducing costs.
