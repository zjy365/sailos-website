The service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer in microservices architecture that focuses on managing inter-service communication. Its importance lies in enhancing system reliability, security, and observability, with application scenarios including cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes, where it handles the distributed complexity of microservices.

The core of a service mesh consists of a data plane (e.g., Envoy proxies handling traffic) and a control plane (e.g., Istio configuring policies), featuring automatic service discovery, load balancing, and failure recovery. Its principle is to inject a sidecar proxy into each service instance to achieve transparent communication management, significantly simplifying traffic control for microservices and supporting deployment strategies like A/B testing.

This technology enables efficient microservice interactions through automated network operations (such as monitoring and security policies), with value reflected in accelerating development cycles, enhancing system resilience and scalability, and reducing operational burdens.
