Multi-cloud deployment involves distributing applications across a multi-cloud environment to leverage the advantages of multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), enhancing business resilience and avoiding vendor lock-in. Its importance lies in supporting high availability, cost optimization, and global compliance requirements, and it is commonly used in disaster recovery and multi-region application scenarios.

Key considerations include cross-cloud cost management for budget control, unified security policies to ensure compliance, network interconnection (such as VPN or SD-WAN) to guarantee reliable data transmission, containerization (such as Kubernetes) to support application portability, and centralized monitoring tools to maintain consistent governance. This drives operational efficiency and enhances business agility.

The application value lies in improving business resilience, flexible resource allocation, and innovative experimentation capabilities, reducing the risk of single-cloud failures, optimizing cost-effectiveness, and ultimately driving digital transformation and competitive advantage.
