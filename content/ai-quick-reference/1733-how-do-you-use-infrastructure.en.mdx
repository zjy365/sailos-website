Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of defining and managing infrastructure resources using code, which is crucial in cloud-native environments. It can automate server configuration, ensure consistency and repeatability, reduce human errors, and support elastic scaling; it is typically applied to automate the deployment of Kubernetes clusters, container orchestration environments, etc., improving agility and resource utilization.

The core of IaC includes tools such as Terraform and Ansible, features such as declarative syntax (declaring resource states through code) or imperative scripts, and version control integration (such as Git). The principle is based on code-driven configuration to automatically execute tasks; practical applications involve defining cloud server specifications and network rules to achieve one-click deployment; impacts include accelerating DevOps processes, enhancing security compliance, and reducing operational costs.

Implementation steps: Select an IaC tool (such as Terraform); write configuration files to define server instances (CPU, storage); integrate through CI/CD pipelines and execute code to automate provisioning and configuration; typical scenarios are used for initializing virtual machines in AWS or GCP, and business values include quickly responding to changes, reducing manual operations, and optimizing resource costs.
