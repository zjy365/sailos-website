  "content": "The key principles of microservices architecture refer to the core design idea of decomposing large applications into small, independent services, emphasizing loose coupling and high cohesion. Its importance lies in enhancing scalability, fault tolerance, and deployment flexibility, making it suitable for complex systems such as e-commerce platforms or cloud-native applications, supporting rapid iteration and team-autonomous development.\n\nCore principles include: 1) Single Responsibility Principle, where each service focuses on a single business function; 2) Service Autonomy, supporting independent development, deployment, scaling, and fault recovery; 3) API-Driven Communication, achieving loosely coupled interactions through lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST or gRPC; 4) Automated Infrastructure, such as containerization and continuous deployment to support efficient operations. These principles are practiced in platforms like Kubernetes, driving highly available and elastically scalable systems, for example, Netflix's microservices architecture enhances fault tolerance.\n\nIts application value lies in accelerating agile development, reducing the risk of single points of failure, and optimizing resource utilization. In business, it enables rapid innovation to respond to changing requirements, significantly improving development efficiency and system reliability, especially creating competitive advantages in digital enterprises."
