IaC (Infrastructure as Code) defines infrastructure configurations through code, enabling automated deployment and consistent management. It is crucial in cloud computing and DevOps, such as supporting CI/CD pipelines, improving repeatability, and reducing human errors.

Core components include declarative tools (e.g., Terraform or Ansible), version control systems (e.g., Git), and audit logs. Features cover traceability, self-healing capabilities, and scalability. In practical applications, it can dynamically optimize resources and avoid configuration drift; impact aspects include accelerating release cycles and enhancing security, especially embedding monitoring feedback loops when handling errors.

Elegant handling steps: 1. Implement automated testing (unit and integration tests) to catch early errors. 2. Configure CI/CD rollback mechanisms (e.g., GitOps) to restore stable states promptly. 3. Integrate centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack) for real-time alerts and analysis. 4. Perform regular audits to maintain fault-tolerant designs. Business value includes minimizing downtime risks, enhancing system resilience, and reducing operational costs.
