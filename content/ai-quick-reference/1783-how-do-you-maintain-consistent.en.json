  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure management using code, ensuring consistency and predictability in deployments. Its importance lies in eliminating human errors, preventing performance degradation, and being suitable for frequently updated application deployments in cloud-native environments.\n\nCore components include declarative configuration tools (such as Terraform), version control, and performance benchmarking. By integrating automated monitoring and load testing into CI/CD pipelines, IaC enables continuous performance validation, ensuring that resource allocation and response times remain stable after updates, thereby enhancing overall system reliability.\n\nImplementation steps: Define performance baselines, incorporate automated testing (such as simulated load) during the deployment phase, and monitor key metrics in real-time; automatically roll back if anomalies occur. The business value lies in reducing downtime risks, enhancing user experience, and optimizing operational efficiency."
