Cloud-native development supports microservice deployment by leveraging cloud computing advantages, with a core focus on automation, elastic resource allocation, and continuous delivery. Key concepts include cloud-native (building applications in cloud environments, such as containerization and service meshes) and microservices (independent, loosely coupled small services). Its importance lies in enhancing scalability, resilience, and deployment efficiency, with application scenarios covering e-commerce platforms or financial systems that require highly available services.

The core components of cloud-native development include containerization (e.g., Docker for encapsulating services), container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes for managing deployments), service discovery, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD pipelines). Features are reflected in principles such as automated scaling, fault isolation, and canary releases. In practical applications, it simplifies microservice management, reduces operational burden, and accelerates innovation—for example, ensuring secure and reliable communication between services through service meshes.

Implementation steps include: 1. Containerizing each microservice; 2. Configuring deployment strategies using orchestration tools; 3. Integrating CI/CD to enable automated testing and release. A typical scenario is large-scale cloud application updates, with business values including cost optimization, increasing deployment speed by over 50%, and enhancing system resilience.
