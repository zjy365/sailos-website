Cloud-native applications are built on cloud infrastructure and achieve elasticity using technologies such as containerization and microservices; real-time data processing instantly analyzes streaming data flows. Their importance lies in supporting rapid decision-making (e.g., risk control), optimizing user experience, and being applied in scenarios like financial transactions and IoT monitoring.

Core components include event-driven architectures (such as message queue Apache Kafka), stream processing engines (such as Apache Flink or Spark Streaming), integrated into Kubernetes clusters to enable automatic scaling and fault tolerance. In practical applications, they support real-time analysis of user behavior, improve system responsiveness, and enhance business agility.

Implementation steps: First, deploy streaming data sources (e.g., Kafka); second, containerize processing applications (e.g., Flink) on Kubernetes; finally, automate monitoring and alerting. A typical scenario is real-time log analysis; the business value is reducing latency by over 30%, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
