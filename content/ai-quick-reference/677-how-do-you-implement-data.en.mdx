Data validation ensures that inputs conform to expected formats, and integrity checks prevent data tampering or loss. In cloud-native applications, these are crucial in microservices and container environments, safeguarding data reliability and security in distributed systems, with application scenarios including API request validation and cross-service communication.

Core components include defining validation rules using schemas (such as JSON Schema), integrating API gateways (such as Kong) or service meshes (such as Istio) for request filtering; ensuring data integrity during transmission through Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption and hash algorithms. In practical applications, it enhances system resilience and reduces the risks of injection attacks and data leakage.

Implementation steps: Define data format specifications; use OpenAPI tools to validate API inputs; use Envoy proxies in Kubernetes deployments to perform runtime checks; monitor logs to audit anomalies. Typical scenarios include user registration form validation or payment transaction integrity. Business value improves accuracy, meets compliance requirements, and optimizes user experience.
