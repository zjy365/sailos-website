  "content": "In a cloud-native development environment, troubleshooting refers to determining the root cause of failures in systems based on containers, microservices, and dynamic orchestration (such as Kubernetes). Its importance lies in the fact that the distributed nature of cloud-native applications leads to complex issues, such as service link interruptions or insufficient resources. Application scenarios include ensuring high availability of microservices, reducing downtime, and supporting agile development and CI/CD pipelines.\n\nCore components include centralized log collection (using tools like Fluentd or ELK), real-time metrics monitoring (such as Prometheus), and distributed tracing (such as Jaeger). These observability tools provide end-to-end visibility. Its characteristics emphasize real-time analysis, scalability, and automation. In practical applications, by tracing request paths and monitoring resource metrics, developers can quickly locate bottlenecks (such as API latency or memory leaks), enhance system resilience, and optimize performance.\n\nImplementation steps: First, enable comprehensive monitoring tool configuration; then analyze anomalies in logs and metrics; use tracing to identify faulty services; finally, optimize code or roll back deployments based on evidence. Typical scenarios include service timeouts. Business values include reducing Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), improving development efficiency, and ensuring user satisfaction."
