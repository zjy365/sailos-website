  "content": "Cloud-native data storage is specifically designed for cloud environments, enabling elastic scalability and high availability to meet the demands of highly dynamic applications such as real-time analytics and event-driven systems. Its importance lies in supporting rapid scaling and high-performance data processing under microservices architectures, with typical application scenarios including e-commerce or IoT platforms running on Kubernetes.\n\nCore components include distributed databases (e.g., Cassandra) and object storage (e.g., Amazon S3), featuring data partitioning, replication, and multi-region deployment. The underlying principle is based on distributed systems, achieving seamless management through auto-scaling and containerization integration (e.g., StatefulSets). In practical applications, it can seamlessly support cloud-native platforms, promote loosely coupled architectures, reduce data bottlenecks, and enhance overall system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: Select cloud-native storage services (e.g., cloud providers' managed databases); Design microservice-friendly data models; Configure Kubernetes StatefulSets to manage stateful containers; Set up automatic backup and recovery mechanisms. Typical scenarios include handling e-commerce peak traffic, with business values including enhanced scalability, reduced operational costs by over 20%, improved reliability, and faster time-to-market."
