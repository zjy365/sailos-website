  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of automating the definition and management of infrastructure resources (servers, networks, storage, etc.) using code such as scripts or declarative configuration files. It treats hardware configuration as software, replacing manual processes with machine-readable definition files. IaC is crucial in modern IT operations as it addresses issues like inconsistent environment configurations, slow deployments, and human errors, serving as the foundation for efficient and predictable deployments. It is mainly applied in building and deploying cloud environments, CI/CD pipelines, and automating infrastructure lifecycle management.\n\nThe core components of IaC include declarative or imperative configuration languages (such as Terraform's HCL, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible Playbooks), version control systems (such as Git), continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools, and configuration management tools. Its core features are automation, consistency, repeatability, and auditability. The practical values are: ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments and reducing configuration drift; tracking the history of infrastructure changes through code version control for quick and reliable rollbacks; increasing deployment speed and frequency; significantly reducing manual configuration errors and operational risks; and enabling precise resource control and cost optimization. It is a key enabling technology for DevOps culture and cloud-native architectures, accelerating business responsiveness through automated delivery processes.\n\nThe core value of IaC in modern DevOps workflows lies in significantly improving efficiency, reliability, and collaboration. Application values: 1) Accelerated delivery: Automating the creation and updating of infrastructure reduces deployment time from days/hours to minutes, supporting continuous delivery. 2) Enhanced consistency: Code ensures complete environment consistency, eliminating the \"\"works in development but not in production\"\" problem. 3) Improved reliability and compliance: Predictable deployment processes and version control provide audit trails, making it easy to verify changes. 4) Reduced costs and risks: Minimizing human errors and enabling precise resource control. Typical scenario: Submitting IaC configuration files to a Git repository triggers a CI/CD pipeline that automatically validates, tests, and deploys infrastructure changes. The resulting business value is faster time-to-market and higher service stability."
