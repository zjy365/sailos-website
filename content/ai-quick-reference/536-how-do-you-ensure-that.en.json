  "content": "Ensuring the communication security of microservices over public networks is crucial, involving the confidentiality, integrity, and tamper-proofing of data transmission to prevent data leakage and unauthorized access. The importance of this concept lies in supporting reliable interactions in distributed systems, with application scenarios including cross-network service deployments in cloud-native environments, such as public cloud services or remote calls in hybrid architectures.\n\nCore components include Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0), and authorization mechanisms. Its characteristics and principles involve implementing end-to-end encryption through certificate management, supplemented by service meshes (e.g., Istio) or API gateways for traffic control. Practical applications enhance system resilience and reduce the attack surface; its impact on related fields is improving the overall security of microservice architectures, facilitating compliance, and enabling the implementation of zero-trust models.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Configure TLS certificate management and enable HTTPS encryption; 2. Deploy service mesh tools for communication policy control; 3. Integrate authentication (e.g., JWT tokens) and authorization checks. A typical scenario is public cloud API calls, with business values including compliance with regulations such as GDPR, enhancing user trust, protecting sensitive data, and supporting secure scalability."
