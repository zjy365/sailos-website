  "content": "Cloud-native application rollback refers to the process of quickly restoring an application to a previously stable version when a failure occurs. Its importance lies in ensuring high availability and business continuity, especially applicable in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) scenarios, such as reducing losses when erroneous updates cause system outages.\n\nThe core components of this process include the version history of Kubernetes Deployment objects and the automation mechanism of CI/CD pipelines. Rollbacks are triggered through tools like Argo CD or Jenkins, with the principle relying on health check monitoring and version control to ensure rapid failure recovery, enhance system resilience and reliability, and reduce the risk of manual intervention.\n\nDuring implementation, first, failures are detected through logs or alerts; second, rollbacks are performed manually or automatically using commands such as `kubectl rollout undo deployment/app-name`; typical scenarios include failed blue-green deployments, where the old version can be restored immediately. The business value includes minimizing downtime, maintaining user experience, and ensuring operational stability."
