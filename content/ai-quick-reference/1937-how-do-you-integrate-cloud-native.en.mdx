Cloud-native applications are built on containers and microservices, leveraging platforms like Kubernetes for elastic scaling and continuous deployment. Analysis tools such as Prometheus process data to support monitoring and decision-making. The importance of integration lies in providing real-time insights, optimizing performance and business continuity, and applying to scenarios such as real-time log analysis, security auditing, and resource utilization monitoring.

The core of this integration involves log and metric data collection (e.g., via Fluentd or Prometheus agents), API connections, and event-driven pipelines (e.g., Kafka or Cloud Pub/Sub). Its features include scalability and observability, with practical impacts such as enhanced system maintainability, support for data-based anomaly detection and resource optimization, significantly improving troubleshooting and operational efficiency in cloud-native environments.

Implementation steps: Deploy data collectors to capture application logs/metrics, configure pipelines to transfer data to analysis tools (e.g., Grafana or ELK Stack), and establish visualization dashboards and alert rules. Typical scenarios include Kubernetes cluster integration, delivering business value such as reduced downtime, accelerated decision-making, and improved user experience.
