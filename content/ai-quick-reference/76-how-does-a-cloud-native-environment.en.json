  "content": "Cloud-native environments are built on containerization, microservices, and dynamic orchestration to achieve elastic scalability and agile deployment of applications. They are crucial in machine learning (ML) testing and deployment, reducing risks and improving efficiency through automated processes. Application scenarios include large-scale AI services and real-time prediction systems, such as recommendation engines or image recognition.\n\nCore components include container tool Docker and orchestration platform Kubernetes, featuring automated deployment, service discovery, and load balancing. The principle involves integrating CI/CD pipelines to automate model performance testing and using infrastructure like Istio to implement canary releases. In practical applications, this accelerates the MLOps cycle, enhances model reliability and high availability, and reduces human errors.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Containerize the model and its dependencies. 2. Validate accuracy and stability during the automated testing phase. 3. Kubernetes deployment supports rolling updates. A typical scenario is the rapid iteration of model versions in production environments. Business values include shortening time-to-market, optimizing resource usage, improving business agility, and cost-effectiveness."
