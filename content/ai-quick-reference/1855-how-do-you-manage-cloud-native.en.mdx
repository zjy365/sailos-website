Cloud-native application lifecycle management encompasses the complete process from code development to production deployment and operations. Its importance lies in ensuring rapid and reliable application delivery, supporting DevOps culture, and enabling high-availability scenarios such as continuous innovation in microservices architectures.

Core components include continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, version control (e.g., Git), infrastructure as code (IaC), and observability tools (e.g., monitoring and logging). These elements enhance efficiency through automated build, testing, and rollback mechanisms, reduce errors, significantly accelerate iterations, and strengthen system resilience.

Implementation steps: Build CI/CD using Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automatically run tests; manage Kubernetes clusters via ArgoCD using GitOps during the deployment phase; integrate Prometheus monitoring and log analysis in the production environment. Business value is reflected in shortened time-to-market, improved resource utilization, and enhanced business agility.
