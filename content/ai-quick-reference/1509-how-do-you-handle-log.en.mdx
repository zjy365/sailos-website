In cloud-native observability, log retention refers to managing the duration of log storage to meet regulatory requirements, while privacy concerns involve protecting sensitive data from leakage. Its importance lies in ensuring system reliability, compliance, and user trust, and it is commonly used in microservice architectures to support auditing and security analysis.

The core includes policy-based log retention (such as time or size limits) and data desensitization technologies (such as masking or anonymizing sensitive fields). Tools like Fluentd or Loki can enable automatic retention and storage integration; privacy protection filters data through log processing pipelines, reducing leakage risks and facilitating compliance applications such as GDPR.

Processing steps: 1. Define retention policies based on regulations; 2. Integrate desensitization tools into the log collection process; 3. Continuously monitor compliance. Value: Reduce storage costs, avoid fines, and enhance data security, suitable for sensitive scenarios such as finance or healthcare.
