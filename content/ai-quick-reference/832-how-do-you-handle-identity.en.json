  "content": "Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial for securing Kubernetes clusters. It involves verifying the identity of users/services (authentication) and controlling their access permissions to cluster resources (authorization). The core goal is to implement the principle of least privilege, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure operational compliance. It is mainly applied in scenarios such as cluster administrators, developers, automated services, and external system access control.\n\nThe core components of Kubernetes IAM are divided into Authentication and Authorization. The authentication layer supports multiple methods to verify the identity of the request source, such as client certificates, Bearer Tokens, ServiceAccount Tokens, and OpenID Connect (OIDC). The authorization layer mainly relies on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): fine-grained permission management is achieved by defining `Role` (namespace permission set) or `ClusterRole` (cluster-wide permission set), and using `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` to associate them with users, groups, or ServiceAccounts. In addition, Admission Control performs additional authorization checks before resource persistence. In practice, IAM significantly reduces the risk of security incidents caused by configuration errors or malicious behaviors.\n\nKey steps for managing Kubernetes IAM:\n\n1. Enable authentication methods: Enable required authentication modules in the API Server configuration (e.g., `--client-ca-file`, `--oidc-`).\n\n2. Define role permissions: Create `Role` or `ClusterRole` using YAML, clearly specifying `resources` and `verbs` (e.g., `pods`, `get`, `list`, `create`).\n\n3. Bind permissions to subjects: Use `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` to associate roles with specific `users`, `groups`, or `ServiceAccounts`.\n\n4. (Optional) Configure network policies: Provide network layer isolation in conjunction with NetworkPolicy.\n\n5. Regular auditing: Use `kubectl auth can-i` or audit logs to check permission configurations. Implementing IAM brings clear business value: enhanced security, compliance fulfillment (such as SOC2, PCI-DSS), secure implementation of multi-tenancy and automation, and clear operational audit trails for运维."
