Cloud-native security tools are specifically designed for containerized environments such as Kubernetes, providing runtime protection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance auditing. Third-party security systems include SIEM, firewalls, or threat intelligence platforms. The importance of integration lies in unifying the security view, avoiding fragmentation, and enhancing the overall security posture. Application scenarios cover hybrid cloud deployments, real-time threat monitoring, and automated DevSecOps workflows.

Core components include API interfaces, event forwarding mechanisms (such as OpenTelemetry or log pipelines), and policy management platforms. Features include support for standardized protocols (such as STIX/TAXII) to achieve data interoperability. The principle is to exchange alert and log data through security gateways and automate workflows. In practical applications, integration accelerates threat detection and response, improves the efficiency of security operations, reduces manual intervention, and has a positive impact on SOC operations and compliance reporting.

Implementation steps: 1. Evaluate requirements and tool compatibility; 2. Configure data source connections, such as log aggregation to SIEM; 3. Enable API integration to synchronize security policies; 4. Test and monitor integration. Typical scenario: Integrating CWPP with external threat intelligence in enterprises. Business values include improving visibility, shortening response time, reducing costs, and strengthening compliance posture.
