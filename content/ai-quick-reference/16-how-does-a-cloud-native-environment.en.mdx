Cloud-native environments enable elastic operation of applications through containerization and microservice architecture, ensuring high availability (HA) in the development process and uninterrupted deployment even in case of component failures. Their importance lies in supporting continuous delivery and rapid iteration, improving development efficiency, and being applied in fields such as finance and e-commerce that require zero downtime.

The core includes Kubernetes orchestration, microservice isolation, automated CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring tools. Kubernetes manages container lifecycle, elastic scaling, and self-healing mechanisms. CI/CD automates building, testing, and deployment, reducing human errors. The practical impact is reducing deployment failure rates, enhancing the reliability of team collaboration, and improving software quality.

Implementation steps: Design services as independent microservices; deploy to Kubernetes clusters to achieve failover; integrate CI/CD tools for automated deployment and rollback; set up monitoring systems such as Prometheus. Business values include minimizing downtime, optimizing resource utilization, supporting agile development, and reducing operational costs.
