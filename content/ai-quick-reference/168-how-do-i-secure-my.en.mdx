Securing cloud-native environments requires attention to the security of containerization, microservices, and dynamic infrastructure. Its importance lies in defending against external attacks, preventing data leaks, and ensuring business continuity and compliance.

Core measures include: network isolation (zero-trust architecture, service mesh policies), enhanced identity authentication (RBAC, service accounts), image scanning (CI/CD pipeline integration), runtime protection (anomaly detection), API security (gateway authentication and rate limiting), and configuration management (Secrets encryption). Practical applications include Kubernetes network policies, admission controllers, and CIS benchmark hardening.

Implementation steps:

1. Network segmentation: Enable namespace isolation and default-deny policies

2. Access control: Implement least-privilege RBAC and mutual mTLS

3. Supply chain security: Image registry scanning and signature verification

4. Monitoring and response: Deploy runtime threat detection tools like Falco

5. Key management: Encrypt Secrets using Vault or KMS

Business value is reflected in reducing intrusion risks, meeting audit requirements, and ensuring a balance between development delivery speed and security.
