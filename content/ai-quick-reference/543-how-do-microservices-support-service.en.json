  "content": "Microservice architecture achieves service isolation by decomposing applications into independent services, each running in its own environment to avoid resource conflicts and cascading failure reactions. Service isolation and fault tolerance are crucial for system robustness, ensuring high availability and rapid recovery in distributed scenarios such as e-commerce and finance.\n\nCore components include clear delineation of service boundaries, independent deployment, and isolation of communication mechanisms; fault tolerance features such as the circuit breaker pattern (e.g., Hystrix) to detect and block faulty services, health checks to automatically restart abnormal instances, and fallback strategies to provide degradation handling. In practical applications, integrating these mechanisms in cloud-native platforms like Kubernetes significantly reduces the scope of failure impact and improves system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps are: 1. Design microservice decomposition boundaries; 2. Deploy an API gateway to control traffic; 3. Integrate circuit breaker tools; 4. Enable monitoring and alerting; 5. Use message queues for asynchronous communication. Typical scenarios involve automatic retries or switching when payment services fail. Business values include reducing downtime risks, enhancing user experience, and supporting agile iteration."
