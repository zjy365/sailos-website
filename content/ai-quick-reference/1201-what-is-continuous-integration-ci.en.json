  "content": "Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository, automatically triggering build and testing processes. Its importance lies in early detection and fixing of errors, improving code quality, and it is suitable for agile development scenarios to support rapid iteration and high-quality delivery.\n\nThe core components of CI include code repository monitors (such as GitHub Action), automated build tools (such as Jenkins), testing frameworks (unit/integration testing), and feedback mechanisms. Its characteristics are reflected in frequent integration, real-time error reporting, and rapid feedback loops, which promote team collaboration. In practical applications, it shortens the testing cycle, reduces release risks, serves as the cornerstone of the CI/CD pipeline, and accelerates software delivery.\n\nThe application of CI focuses on automated processes, and its values include reducing human errors, accelerating time to market, improving development efficiency, and helping enterprises achieve continuous improvement and competitive advantages."
