Microservices is an architectural style that splits monolithic applications into small, independent services to enhance scalability, agile deployment, and fault isolation capabilities. It is widely used in complex systems such as e-commerce and finance to achieve rapid iteration and business innovation.

The core challenges in implementing microservices include the complexity brought by distributed systems, such as inter-service communication delays, data consistency issues (e.g., constraints of the CAP theorem), monitoring integration, deployment coordination, and team cultural transformation. These factors increase debugging difficulty and operational costs, but the use of containerization (such as Kubernetes) and service mesh tools can optimize management and significantly improve system resilience.

The application of understanding challenges lies in risk prevention strategies, and the value is reflected in achieving business agility by overcoming obstacles, such as shortening time-to-market, enhancing fault tolerance, supporting continuous delivery, and driving innovative competitiveness.
