  "content": "Observability is the ability to monitor the internal state of a system by collecting logs, metrics, and tracing data. It is indispensable in cloud-native security strategies as it provides real-time visibility, helping to quickly identify and respond to security threats in dynamic microservice environments, thereby enhancing overall resilience and compliance.\n\nThe core components include log aggregation, performance metrics, and distributed tracing systems. Integrating these components into the security framework enables real-time detection of abnormal behaviors (such as attack patterns), reduces vulnerability risks, and accelerates incident response through automatic alerts, thereby strengthening security protection capabilities and reducing the business impact of potential downtime.\n\nImplementation steps include deploying monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Jaeger, configuring security alert rules, and integrating Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. It is typically applied in Kubernetes environments to achieve full-link tracing. Its business value is reflected in shortening threat response time, ensuring compliance standards, and supporting business continuity management."
