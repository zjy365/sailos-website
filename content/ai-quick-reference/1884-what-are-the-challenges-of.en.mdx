Container technology is a key component in cloud-native development, providing lightweight, isolated runtime environments that support application portability and elastic scaling. Its importance lies in accelerating development cycles and resource efficiency; application scenarios include microservice deployment and continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

The core challenges include security risks (such as image vulnerabilities and container escape), network configuration complexity (service discovery and load balancing), storage management issues (persistent volumes), and difficulty in performance monitoring. These increase operational complexity, leading to potential security incidents and application instability, affecting development iteration speed and cost control.

The application of these challenges highlights the need for enhanced security auditing and automation tools; their value lies in driving enterprises to invest in infrastructure optimization, improving application reliability and business agility, and supporting more efficient cloud-native transformation.
