Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. The key to automating application deployment in cloud-native environments lies in its distributed architecture and intelligent scheduling mechanisms. Its importance lies in improving deployment efficiency, reliability, and scalability, and it is widely used especially in microservices architectures, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and hybrid cloud scenarios, reducing manual intervention and error risks.

Its core components such as API server, scheduler, and controllers define application states through declarative configurations (YAML files), and automatically perform tasks such as container placement, health checks, and self-healing processing. Features include rolling updates, horizontal scaling, and policy-based orchestration, which promote DevOps practices, significantly accelerate the development cycle, optimize resource utilization, and support highly available applications.

Implementation steps include: deploying applications using kubectl to apply configuration files; Kubernetes automatically handles container startup, monitoring, and failure recovery. A typical scenario is deploying cloud-native services such as e-commerce platforms. The business value is reflected in shortening deployment time to minutes, improving system resilience, and reducing operation and maintenance costs.
