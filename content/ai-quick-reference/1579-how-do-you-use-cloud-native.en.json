  "content": "Cloud-native observability refers to methods for monitoring, tracing, and understanding application status in cloud environments. Its importance lies in promptly identifying performance bottlenecks and preventing system failures, applicable to distributed systems like Kubernetes to ensure stable application operation.\n\nIts core includes three main components: logs, metrics, and traces, characterized by real-time data collection and end-to-end analysis. Practical applications cover monitoring microservice interactions and resource utilization; the impact is reducing service disruptions through early problem detection, enhancing overall reliability and efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Jaeger); configure custom metrics and alert thresholds; continuously optimize resource allocation. Business values include minimizing downtime costs, improving user experience, and maintaining system resilience."
