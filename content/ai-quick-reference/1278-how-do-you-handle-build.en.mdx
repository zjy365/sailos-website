Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is an automated software delivery process where build failure refers to errors in the code compilation or testing phase, endangering code quality and rapid release. It is crucial in the development environment, such as applications deployed in containerized microservices, to ensure reliability.

The core components of build failure include real-time monitoring, log analysis (e.g., error stack diagnosis), and repair mechanisms, characterized by using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI to achieve rapid feedback. In practical applications, response is triggered through alert notifications, significantly reducing deployment delays and improving team collaboration efficiency, such as preventing production outages in Kubernetes cloud-native environments.

Processing steps: 1. Automatically detect failures and send notifications; 2. Analyze build logs to determine the root cause; 3. Developers fix the problem and submit changes; 4. Rerun the build to verify the fix. Typical scenarios include test failures, and the business value lies in maintaining high-frequency releases, reducing costs, and improving product stability.
