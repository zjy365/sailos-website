  "content": "CI/CD pipelines automate software building, testing, and deployment, which are crucial for handling complex workflows such as multi-stage releases or parallel testing. They ensure efficient and reliable delivery, widely used in microservices or cloud-native environments.\n\nThe core includes declarative configuration tools like Argo CD, stage dependency management, and event-driven mechanisms, supporting parallel execution and rollbacks. GitOps simplifies the deployment of large-scale projects, enhances security, reduces manual errors, and facilitates rapid iteration.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Map workflow logic and define stages; 2. Configure automation using tools such as Jenkins or Tekton; 3. Integrate monitoring and rollback mechanisms. Business values include accelerating release cycles, reducing risks, and improving team collaboration efficiency."
