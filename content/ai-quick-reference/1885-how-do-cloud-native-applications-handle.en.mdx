Cloud-native applications manage diverse data through a unified data access layer and abstract processing mechanisms. Their core value lies in addressing the real-time processing needs of massive heterogeneous data (JSON, XML, binary streams, time-series data, etc.) and multiple sources (databases, message queues, APIs, IoT devices, log files, etc.) in modern applications, supporting dynamic scaling and agile iteration to adapt to hybrid cloud environments.

Key technologies include: 1. Data format converters and adapter patterns to automatically parse different formats (e.g., Protobuf, Avro Schema Registry); 2. Asynchronous message middleware (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar) to decouple data sources from applications and buffer high-throughput data; 3. Sidecar patterns and service meshes (e.g., Dapr) to provide standardized APIs for connecting various databases and messaging systems; 4. File/object storage integration (e.g., S3 API-compatible storage) to handle unstructured data; 5. Stream-batch integrated processing frameworks (e.g., Flink on K8s) for unified processing logic.

Implementation steps are: Deploy data ingestion services with containerized data source connectors; Design Schema definition standards; Expose unified data endpoints through Service Mesh; Data preprocessing services perform format cleaning and conversion; Publish converted data to internal standard-format message buses or data lakes. This solution reduces development complexity, improves data availability and system resilience, and accelerates data-driven business insights.
