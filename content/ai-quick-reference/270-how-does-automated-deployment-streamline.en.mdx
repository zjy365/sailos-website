Automated deployment refers to the process of automatically applying code changes in software delivery, eliminating manual intervention to simplify the continuous integration (CI) process. Its importance lies in seamlessly connecting code commits, builds, and testing to accelerate the iteration cycle; it is applied in agile development and cloud-native systems to reduce human errors and support rapid product delivery.

The core components include automation tools (such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD), version control triggers, and containerized environments (such as Kubernetes); features include automated testing pipelines, environment consistency, and rollback mechanisms. In practice, it integrates the build, test, and deployment phases, reducing failure rates, increasing deployment frequency, affecting DevOps efficiency, and enabling teams to launch new versions within hours.

Implementing automated deployment requires defining a CI/CD pipeline: steps such as setting up triggers (automatic builds after code merging), running test scripts, and deploying to target environments. A typical scenario is that each code push triggers a full-process deployment; the business value shortens the release cycle to minutes, reduces risks, improves resource utilization, and supports business innovation.
