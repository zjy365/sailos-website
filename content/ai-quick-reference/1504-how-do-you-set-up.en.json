  "content": "Cloud-native alert rules are mechanisms for monitoring system anomalies and sending notifications, ensuring application reliability and efficient operation. Their importance lies in preventing failures and maintaining service continuity, with application scenarios including monitoring container resources (such as CPU usage) and service health status in Kubernetes clusters.\n\nCore components involve monitoring metric collection (e.g., Prometheus), threshold definition (e.g., memory exceeding 80%), and notification channel integration. Features include real-time detection and automated response. In practical applications, configuring alerts can quickly identify performance bottlenecks, improve operational efficiency, and reduce the impact of service interruptions on the stability of cloud-native environments.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy Prometheus and integrate Alertmanager; 2. Define rule files to configure trigger conditions and thresholds; 3. Set up notification channels (e.g., Slack or Email); 4. Test the validity of the rules. The business value is to ensure high availability and reduce downtime risks, with typical scenarios including Kubernetes automatic alert responses to resource overlimits."
