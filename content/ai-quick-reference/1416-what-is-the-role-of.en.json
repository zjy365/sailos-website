  "content": "Service meshes like Istio serve as the foundational layer of cloud-native architectures, responsible for managing communication, security, and policies between microservices. In observability, they provide deep visibility into distributed systems. Their importance lies in enhancing fault diagnosis, performance monitoring, and system reliability, applied in microservice environments to ensure business continuity.\n\nCore components include proxies (such as Envoy Sidecar), which automatically collect telemetry data like metrics (latency, error rates), logs, and distributed traces. Features involve standardized data export and integration with tools like Prometheus or Jaeger. In practical applications, they support visualizing service topologies, identifying bottlenecks, and real-time anomaly detection, thereby reducing problem resolution time and optimizing resource utilization.\n\nIts applications include monitoring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and debugging cross-service issues. The value lies in enhancing operational transparency, improving service resilience, and supporting scenarios like A/B testing through data-driven decision-making, driving business innovation."
