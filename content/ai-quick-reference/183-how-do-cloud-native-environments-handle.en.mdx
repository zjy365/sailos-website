Cloud-native environment refers to a distributed application platform built using containers, microservices, and cloud services. Database replication is a key mechanism for synchronizing data between nodes to improve availability and fault tolerance. Its importance lies in supporting high concurrency, auto-scaling, preventing data loss, and being applied in critical business scenarios such as e-commerce payments.

The core components include database clusters (e.g., master-slave architecture), Kubernetes StatefulSets for managing persistent storage, and consistency protocols (e.g., Raft). Features include automated failover, read-write separation, and near real-time synchronization. In practice, it is implemented through tools such as Vitess or cloud services (e.g., Amazon RDS Proxy), significantly improving system resilience, with the impact of simplifying operations and reducing latency.

Implementation steps include: 1. Selecting a replication strategy (asynchronous or synchronous); 2. Deploying StatefulSets on Kubernetes via Helm Charts; 3. Configuring replica sets and health checks; 4. Integrating Prometheus monitoring. Typical scenarios include handling peak traffic, and the business value is ensuring zero downtime and optimizing resource utilization.
