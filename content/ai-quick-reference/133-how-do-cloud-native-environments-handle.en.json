  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, fault recovery refers to the system's ability to automatically resume operation when components fail. This is crucial for ensuring continuous application availability, high resilience, and business continuity, and is widely applicable to microservices, containerized deployments, and high-load scenarios.\n\nCore mechanisms include Kubernetes health checks (such as Liveness Probes to detect container liveness), ReplicaSets to automatically restart failed instances, and auto-scaling policies. These controller and API-based designs enable self-healing, significantly enhancing system resilience and reducing manual intervention.\n\nImplementation steps include configuring health monitoring, setting up replication policies, and service mesh integration; a typical application is Web traffic failover. The business value lies in achieving rapid recovery, near-zero downtime, and improved cost efficiency."
