  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, ensuring proper logging and error tracking is crucial for maintaining system reliability, quickly diagnosing issues, and optimizing services. Since applications are typically composed of multiple distributed microservices and run dynamically on container platforms (such as Kubernetes), traditional logging and error handling methods are no longer applicable. It supports troubleshooting, performance analysis, security auditing, and continuous improvement.\n\nCore practices include: centralized log collection (using agents like Fluentd/Fluent Bit, Filebeat) to ensure all container logs are collected; structured logging (JSON format) for easy machine parsing and filtering; unique request identifiers (such as OpenTelemetry TraceID) injected into all logs and errors to enable tracing across service call chains; dedicated error tracking systems (such as Sentry, Datadog Errors) to aggregate, deduplicate, alert, and analyze exception stacks; and platform integration to annotate logs with Kubernetes metadata. This forms a key part of the observability pillar, making operations transparent.\n\nImplementation steps: develop unified log output specifications (format, level); deploy log collectors as DaemonSets; select storage backends (such as Elasticsearch, Loki) and visualization tools (Kibana, Grafana); configure error collection tools and integrate APM traceIDs; set up alert policies for critical errors; continuously audit and optimize log content and sampling rates. Ultimately, an efficient troubleshooting closed loop is achieved: discovering clues from logs, locating issues through Traces, and analyzing root causes on error platforms, thereby improving MTTR and service quality."
