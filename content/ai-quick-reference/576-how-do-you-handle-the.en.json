  "content": "Service discovery is the process of automatically detecting and managing the locations of service instances in cloud-native microservices. It is crucial for enabling reliable communication between services, load balancing, and elastic scaling, with application scenarios including Kubernetes clusters and highly dynamic deployments in distributed systems.\n\nThe core components include a service registry (such as Kubernetes DNS or etcd), characterized by dynamic registration/deregistration, health checks, and integration with load balancing; its principle is based on clients querying registration data. In practical applications, it improves system scalability and fault tolerance, simplifies运维, and reduces manual configuration errors.\n\nProcessing steps: 1. Deploy a registry tool (e.g., Consul). 2. Services automatically register metadata when starting. 3. Clients obtain real-time instance addresses through API or DNS queries. A typical scenario is internal calls between microservices; business values include enhanced automation, accelerated fault recovery, and optimized resource utilization."
