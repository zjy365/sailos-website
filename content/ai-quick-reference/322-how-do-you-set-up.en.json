  "content": "A production-like environment refers to a testing environment that simulates a production system. Its importance lies in verifying the stability of applications under real-world conditions through automated testing, ensuring release reliability and reducing production failures. Application scenarios include CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native deployments.\n\nCore components include infrastructure configuration tools (such as Terraform or Kubernetes), test framework integration (such as Selenium or Postman), and monitoring and log analysis functions; features like isolation and scalability support end-to-end testing and data consistency. In practical applications, automated testing improves development efficiency, reduces manual errors, and enables rapid rollback and cost optimization in cloud-native architectures.\n\nTo set up automated testing: first, analyze production environment requirements to configure testing infrastructure; second, use IaC tools to deploy the production-like environment; third, integrate and run test scripts for verification; finally, monitor results to optimize the process. Typical scenarios include stress testing of Kubernetes clusters, with business value in accelerating release cycles, reducing defect rates, and supporting continuous delivery."
