Cloud-native environments significantly enhance the scalability of application development through key technologies such as microservices architecture, containerization, dynamic orchestration, and declarative APIs. Their importance lies in supporting on-demand elastic resource allocation to adapt to changes in business loads. Typical application scenarios include high-traffic internet services, rapidly iterating business systems, and large-scale distributed applications.

At its core is the provision of lightweight, consistent runtime units through containers (e.g., Docker); Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management; service meshes (e.g., Istio) to simplify inter-service communication; and CI/CD pipelines to support continuous delivery. These features enable independent scaling of application components, fault isolation, and lossless rolling updates, greatly reducing the complexity of horizontal scaling.

Implementation steps include: 1) Decomposing monolithic applications into microservices; 2) Containerizing each microservice; 3) Deploying with Kubernetes and configuring HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler); 4) Managing traffic and elasticity policies through a service mesh; 5) Setting up monitoring and alerting to drive automatic scaling. Business value lies in real-time response to traffic peaks, optimized resource utilization, support for rapid business innovation, and high service availability.
