Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the management and deployment of infrastructure using code. Its key advantage lies in enhancing the efficiency of Disaster Recovery (DR) and High Availability (HA) by eliminating manual errors and enabling consistent, repeatable configurations. This is crucial in cloud computing, as it allows for rapid service recovery, minimizes downtime, and is applicable in multi-cloud environments or mission-critical business systems to ensure business continuity and compliance.

Core components include declarative tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, which define resources like virtual machines, load balancers, and databases through version control systems (e.g., Git). Features encompass repeatability, test-driven development, and automation strategies. In DR/HA scenarios, IaC automatically creates redundant infrastructure (e.g., multi-region deployments) and failover mechanisms, improving system resilience and recovery speed while reducing risks. For cloud-native architectures, it significantly optimizes operational costs and reliability.

Implementation steps: 1. Define DR/HA components using IaC (e.g., configuring redundant servers and automated backups); 2. Integrate version control and continuous integration pipelines; 3. Test failure scenarios (e.g., simulating regional outages); 4. Automate deployment and recovery. Typical use cases include seamless switching between primary and backup sites when deploying applications across clouds. Business value includes achieving near-zero downtime, enhancing Service Level Objectives (SLOs), reducing losses, supporting rapid scaling, and enabling agile responses.
