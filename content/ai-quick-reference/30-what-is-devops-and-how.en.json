  "content": "DevOps is a culture, practice, and toolchain that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops), aiming to accelerate the software development lifecycle through automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery. Its importance lies in improving efficiency, reducing errors, and supporting agile iterations, which are applied in cloud-native development to achieve elastic resource scaling and microservice management. Cloud-native development is a modern methodology for building applications to leverage cloud services (such as containers and microservices), promoting portability and dynamic scalability.\n\nThe core components of DevOps include CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins), automated testing, and monitoring tools, with its characteristics emphasizing cultural transformation and rapid feedback loops. Cloud-native relies on containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), providing dynamic service discovery and fault recovery capabilities. The relationship between the two is reflected in the wide application of DevOps practices in cloud-native environments, driving efficient deployment and seamless operations, thereby optimizing resource utilization and reducing operational complexity.\n\nIn cloud-native development, DevOps is applied to automated deployment pipelines, supporting continuous integration and monitoring of microservices. Business values include shortening time-to-market, enhancing system reliability, and reducing costs. This relationship promotes iterative innovation and business agility of cloud-native applications, suitable for enterprises' hybrid cloud or multi-cloud strategies to enhance overall competitiveness."
