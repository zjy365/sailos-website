Testing the security of cloud-native applications refers to integrating security measures throughout the development cycle to detect and remediate risks, ensuring the integrity of distributed, containerized environments. Its importance lies in reducing data breaches, preventing attacks, and promoting compliance; application scenarios include coding, CI/CD deployment, and runtime management.

Core components include Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for analyzing source code, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for scanning runtime vulnerabilities, as well as container security scanning for inspecting images and infrastructure-as-code security. In practice, these are integrated into automated CI/CD pipelines, providing continuous feedback through tools like Trivy or Clair; cloud-native security enhances microservice resilience, fosters DevSecOps culture, and reduces overall risk.

Implementation steps: first, integrate security tools into CI/CD phases for automated scanning; second, perform code reviews and configure policies such as RBAC; finally, deploy runtime monitoring and auditing. A typical scenario involves triggering tests upon development commits to ensure security shifting left; business values include reducing remediation costs, accelerating compliance validation, and enhancing reliability.
