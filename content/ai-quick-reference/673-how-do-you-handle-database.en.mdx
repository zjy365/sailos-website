Database sharding is the process of dividing data into smaller, logically independent segments (shards) distributed across multiple database nodes. In cloud-native applications, it is crucial as it enhances scalability and performance, particularly suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce platforms or real-time analytics systems. By distributing the load, it reduces the pressure on individual nodes, optimizing response times and resource utilization.

The core principle is based on selecting shard keys (such as user IDs or timestamps) and strategies (such as hash or range sharding) to ensure uniform data distribution. In Kubernetes, StatefulSets are used to manage stateful shard instances, enabling automatic scaling and load balancing. In practical applications, sharding reduces query latency, increases throughput, supports hundreds of millions of users through horizontal scaling, enhances system resilience and availability, and lowers the risk of single points of failure.

Processing steps include: 1. Define shard keys to balance data. 2. Deploy sharding strategies in Kubernetes StatefulSets. 3. Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus to optimize performance. 4. Implement automatic scaling. A typical scenario is large-scale social networks; business values include improving user experience, reducing latency costs, and supporting high-growth business needs.
