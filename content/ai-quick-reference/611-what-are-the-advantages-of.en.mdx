In cloud-native architecture, distributed databases process transactions by dispersing data across multiple nodes, addressing single-point performance bottlenecks and failure risks. Their importance lies in supporting the elastic scaling and high availability of microservices, making them suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce and finance, ensuring business continuity and response speed.

Core features include horizontal scalability (adding nodes to increase throughput), multi-replica high availability (automatic failover), and data partitioning (e.g., Sharding) to optimize query efficiency. Consistency is ensured through consensus algorithms (e.g., Raft/Paxos). In practical applications, globally deployed e-commerce platforms can handle millions of orders, while content distribution platforms can reduce cross-region latency.

The main advantages are improved system elasticity and fault tolerance, support for large-scale concurrent access, and seamless integration with cloud-native toolchains like Kubernetes to achieve automated scaling and运维. Their core value lies in reducing downtime risks, optimizing resource utilization, and providing continuous and reliable database services for businesses.
