  "content": "Cloud-native tools refer to software based on cloud-native principles, such as Kubernetes, service meshes, and monitoring tools, used to manage containerized applications. Their integration in hybrid cloud environments is crucial, ensuring consistency, elastic scalability, and resource optimization across private and public clouds. Application scenarios include enterprise application migration, disaster recovery, and data sovereignty compliance, enhancing the flexibility of overall cloud strategies.\n\nThe integration core includes standardized container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes clusters), unified service governance tools (e.g., Istio service mesh), and cross-cloud monitoring solutions. Its features are automated deployment, portability, and microservice support. Practical applications enable seamless migration and expansion of applications in hybrid environments through unified APIs and CI/CD pipelines, with significant impacts: enhancing development agility, improving resource utilization, and promoting business continuity.\n\nThe implementation steps are as follows: first, evaluate the hybrid infrastructure and select compatible tools; second, deploy core platforms such as Kubernetes; then integrate service meshes and monitoring tools; finally, automate workflow management. Typical scenarios include hybrid disaster recovery, with business values including cost reduction, enhanced application resilience, and accelerated innovation speed."
