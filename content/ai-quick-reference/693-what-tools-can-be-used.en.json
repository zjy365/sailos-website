  "content": "Cloud-native storage system monitoring involves using tools to monitor the performance, availability, and data consistency of containerized storage. Its importance lies in ensuring the reliability and failure recovery of persistent storage in Kubernetes environments, with application scenarios including data protection and service continuity in production environments.\n\nThe core components include metric collectors, visualization dashboards, and alert mechanisms; features include support for the Prometheus protocol, integration with CSI drivers, and Kubernetes native APIs. In practical applications, tools provide real-time IOPS, latency, and capacity metrics to optimize storage strategies, with impacts including reducing bottlenecks, enhancing security compliance, and improving cost efficiency.\n\nAvailable tools include Prometheus (metric scraping), Grafana (visualization analysis), ELK Stack (log management), and Jaeger (distributed tracing); they are applied in monitoring storage health, with values such as improving failure response speed, ensuring business continuity, and enhancing data reliability."
