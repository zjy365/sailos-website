Cloud data security and compliance involve protecting data across multiple cloud environments to prevent breaches while adhering to regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Its importance lies in mitigating data risks and avoiding legal liabilities, with key application scenarios including data storage and processing in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare.

Core components include encryption (at rest and in transit), identity and access management (IAM), policy enforcement tools (e.g., OPA), and audit logs. In principle, a unified policy framework enables consistent cross-cloud control through cloud-native storage interfaces (e.g., CSI). In practical applications, combining Kubernetes-native tools (e.g., Velero or Rook) with third-party services (CASB) automates compliance checks and reduces the impact of violations.

Processing steps: 1. Implement end-to-end encryption and tokenization; 2. Configure fine-grained access policies; 3. Deploy continuous monitoring and audit tools; 4. Conduct regular compliance assessments. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud data migration to ensure secure transfer; business values include reducing risk costs by 20-30%, enhancing data sovereignty, and optimizing cloud resource utilization.
