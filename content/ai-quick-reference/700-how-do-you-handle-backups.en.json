  "content": "Cloud-native applications rely on containerization and microservices architecture, emphasizing elasticity and agility. Backup and disaster recovery ensure data integrity, business continuity, and high availability, preventing data loss or service disruptions in cross-cloud or multi-cluster environments, and are widely used in high-demand scenarios such as finance and e-commerce.\n\nThe core includes Kubernetes-based tools (such as Velero) to implement volume snapshots and resource backups. The principles involve snapshot creation, consistent recovery, and automation of disaster recovery plans. Features include portability of application states and recovery point objective (RPO) management. In practical applications, system resilience is enhanced through cross-region replication, and the impact is reducing operational complexity.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy backup tools like Velero; configure regular backup schedules and snapshots; test disaster recovery scenarios to validate processes. Typical scenarios include cross-availability zone failover; business value lies in reducing downtime, meeting compliance requirements, and ensuring operational continuity."
