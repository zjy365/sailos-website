  "content": "Cloud-native applications are scalable and resilient applications built in cloud environments, emphasizing containerization and microservices design. Their importance lies in enhancing application high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring services continue to run in the face of hardware or software failures, making them suitable for critical business scenarios such as e-commerce and finance.\n\nCore components include fault isolation, automatic recovery mechanisms, and redundant design; features such as automatic restart, health checks, and rolling updates provided by container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes). By implementing self-healing capabilities, these mechanisms can quickly detect and handle node or service failures, reduce downtime impact, and promote continuous delivery and system resilience enhancement.\n\nImplementation steps include: deploying a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes, configuring health probes and resource limits; setting up multi-replica services and automatic scaling; integrating monitoring tools for real-time alerts. A typical scenario is application in microservices architecture, bringing business values such as reducing downtime losses, improving user experience, and supporting compliance."
