  "content": "Cloud identity management unifies authentication and authorization mechanisms to coordinate user access across multiple cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). It is crucial as it ensures consistent cross-cloud security, prevents credential proliferation, and supports compliance requirements. Application scenarios include integrated resource access and security policy enforcement in enterprise multi-cloud strategies.\n\nCore components include Single Sign-On (SSO), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and a centralized policy engine, with principles based on standard protocols such as SAML/OIDC to link identity providers. Features encompass fine-grained permission assignment and dynamic access updates. In practical applications, user permissions are uniformly managed through identity providers (e.g., Azure AD or Okta), reducing multi-account risks, improving operational efficiency, and adapting to hybrid cloud environment needs.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Select a centralized identity source (e.g., Active Directory); 2) Configure SAML/OIDC to implement SSO; 3) Define RBAC roles and map cloud platform policies; 4) Regularly audit access logs. Business values include reducing security vulnerabilities, saving management costs by over 30%, accelerating multi-cloud compliance governance, and supporting agile business expansion."
