  "content": "Multi-cloud deployment utilizes multiple cloud service providers to run workloads, avoiding reliance on a single vendor. The importance of avoiding vendor lock-in lies in enhancing flexibility, reducing migration costs, and being widely applied in disaster recovery and geographical distribution scenarios.\n\nCore strategies include containerization such as Kubernetes for standardized deployment, API abstraction layers for unified service access, and open-source tools to ensure cross-cloud compatibility. These features provide architectural portability, facilitate seamless application migration, and impact the cloud-native ecosystem by enhancing competitiveness and reducing dependency risks.\n\nThe application of these strategies enables enterprises to quickly switch cloud platforms, reducing negotiation disadvantages and business disruptions. The values include optimizing total cost of ownership, improving agility, and supporting technical neutrality."
