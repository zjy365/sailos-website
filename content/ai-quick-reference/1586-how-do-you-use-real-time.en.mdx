Real-time analysis and monitoring of cloud-native applications involves continuously processing log, metric, and trace data streams generated by applications and their underlying infrastructure (such as Kubernetes clusters) to achieve second-level insights. This enables rapid detection of performance bottlenecks, abnormal behaviors, and faults, ensuring application availability and performance.

Its core components include: data collection (Agents like Fluentd/OpenTelemetry Agent) that continuously gather runtime data from Pods, nodes, and services; stream processing engines (such as Apache Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark Streaming) that perform real-time aggregation and computation on massive high-throughput data; storage and query engines (like Elasticsearch, Druid) that support low-latency queries; and alerting and visualization tools (such as Grafana, Prometheus Alertmanager) that provide real-time status presentation and trigger notifications. Key features include low latency (second/millisecond level), scalability, and the ability to process infinite data streams. This supports dynamic scaling decisions, real-time anomaly detection (e.g., sudden increases in call latency), precise SLA monitoring, and instantaneous fault localization.

Implementation steps: 1) Instrumentation and collection: Configure Agents to collect application/middleware/K8s metrics, logs, and traces. 2) Data stream ingestion: Ingest data into message queues (Kafka). 3) Real-time processing: Use stream processing engines to define analysis rules (e.g., window aggregation to calculate error rates). 4) Storage and query: Store computation results for real-time querying. 5) Visualization and alerting: Configure dashboards and threshold-based alerts on platforms like Grafana. Business value includes significantly reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR), improving system availability and user experience, and providing real-time basis for automatic scaling.
