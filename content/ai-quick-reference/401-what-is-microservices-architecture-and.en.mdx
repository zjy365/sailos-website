Microservices architecture is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small, loosely coupled services, each built around specific business capabilities with independent processes and data management capabilities. It enhances system flexibility, maintainability, and scalability through service decoupling, emerging as a core design pattern for modern cloud-native applications (such as e-commerce platforms and streaming services) to address rapid iteration and complex business requirements.

Key characteristics of this architecture include service independence (enabling independent development, deployment, and scaling), technological heterogeneity (allowing different services to use the most suitable technology stacks), decentralized governance (e.g., independent databases), and lightweight communication via APIs (typically REST or gRPC). Services are usually run as containers and orchestrated by platforms like Kubernetes. Practical impacts include driving DevOps culture, enabling continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD), and transforming the complexity of maintaining large monolithic applications into that of managing distributed systems.

The value of microservices architecture lies in significantly shortening the delivery cycle of business functions, increasing flexibility in technology selection, and enhancing system fault tolerance (a single service failure rarely causes overall system collapse). Typical implementation steps include: identifying service boundaries (domain-driven design), setting up independent data storage for services, deploying API gateways to handle routing/authentication, implementing deployment automation using containerization and orchestration tools (e.g., Docker/Kubernetes), and establishing comprehensive monitoring and logging systems. This structure enables large teams to work in parallel and supports on-demand resource scaling for specific services.
