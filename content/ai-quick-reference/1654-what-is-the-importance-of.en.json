  "content": "Modularity in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts decomposes infrastructure into reusable, independent units, enhancing maintainability and consistency. It is applied in the automated deployment of cloud platforms such as AWS or Kubernetes clusters.\n\nIts core includes input variable definitions, output interfaces, and resource encapsulation, supporting parameterized configurations; its features are abstracting implementation details and reducing redundancy. Practical applications promote team collaboration and version control, reduce errors, and accelerate CI/CD processes.\n\nThe application value lies in simplifying infrastructure management, optimizing resource configuration efficiency, supporting rapid iteration, ultimately reducing operational costs and enhancing business agility."
