Cloud-native environments utilize containers (such as Docker), microservices, and automation tools (such as Kubernetes) to build and run scalable applications on cloud computing platforms. Optimizing the development process is crucial for enhancing agility, reliability, and efficiency, and is suitable for continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) and rapid iteration scenarios.

Core components include containerization (isolating application environments), orchestration (managing container lifecycles), microservices architecture (decoupling functions), and CI/CD pipelines (automating builds and testing). Features include automation, scalability, and elastic monitoring; the principle is to achieve rapid feedback loops through cloud infrastructure. In practical applications, automated deployment and log analysis improve efficiency, with impacts including shortened release cycles and enhanced team collaboration.

Implementation steps: 1) Containerized application deployment; 2) Integration of CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI); 3) Addition of monitoring systems (such as Prometheus); 4) Adoption of microservice design; 5) Automated testing and rollback. Typical scenario: Agile development environment. Business value: Accelerated release speed, reduced failure rates, and optimized resource costs.
