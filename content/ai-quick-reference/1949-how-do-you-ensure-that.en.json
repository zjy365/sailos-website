  "content": "Cloud-native applications refer to scalable and resilient modern applications built on cloud infrastructure, emphasizing resource optimization and automation. Their importance lies in significantly reducing operational costs (such as pay-as-you-go pricing) and improving efficiency (e.g., rapid deployment), making them suitable for scenarios like microservices architecture and real-time data processing.\n\nCore components include containerization (e.g., Docker for application packaging), orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes for resource management), and continuous integration/delivery tools (e.g., Jenkins for automated deployment). Features such as auto-scaling and service discovery mechanisms ensure high availability. In practical applications, elastic resource adjustment is used to handle traffic peaks, and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) are leveraged to optimize resource usage, reduce waste, and drive business innovation.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Adopt container technology and Kubernetes for orchestrated application deployment; 2) Configure auto-scaling policies (e.g., based on CPU usage); 3) Integrate cost monitoring tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer) for regular audits; 4) Continuously test and optimize resource configurations. A typical scenario is handling peak traffic in e-commerce. Business value: Reduce infrastructure costs by up to 30%, improve system response speed, and support agile iteration."
