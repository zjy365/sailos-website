Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key concept for defining and automating the management of infrastructure resources through code. In cloud-native environments, it is crucial as it supports agile configuration, consistency, and repeatability, applicable to containerized deployments such as Kubernetes and microservices architectures, accelerating application delivery.

The core features of IaC include declarative configuration, version control integration, and tools like Terraform. In principle, resource states are defined through scripts, enabling automated deployment and updates. Practical applications include automating cloud resource provisioning, supporting CI/CD pipelines, significantly improving reliability and scalability, and reducing human errors.

Its role lies in promoting auditable and reproducible infrastructure management. In cloud-native contexts, it enables elastic resource scaling and consistent management, optimizing costs and enhancing resilience. Business values include缩短上市时间, improving compliance, and increasing system maintenance efficiency.
