The core of preventing the production environment from being affected by pipeline failures lies in establishing a reliably isolated continuous delivery process to ensure that code is fully validated before deployment.

Key measures include: 1) Strict environment isolation (development/testing/production); 2) Automated testing gates (unit, integration, end-to-end testing); 3) Progressive deployment strategies (canary release, blue-green deployment). These mechanisms enable failures to be exposed during the testing phase and block the spread of issues through pre-validation and risk control.

Implementation steps: 1) Build an independent pre-production environment; 2) Add quality checkpoints in the automated deployment pipeline; 3) Implement rolling updates and traffic switching; 4) Establish a monitoring, alerting, and circuit-breaking mechanism. Through process constraints and automated safeguards, the production accident rate can be reduced by more than 90%.
