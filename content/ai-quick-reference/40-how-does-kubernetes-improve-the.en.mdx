Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used to automate the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications. Cloud-native development environments are based on containers and microservices, emphasizing elasticity, scalability, and automation. Improving their management can enhance development efficiency, environmental consistency, and reliability, and is widely applicable to microservice architectures and continuous delivery scenarios.

Kubernetes achieves automated scaling, service discovery, and rolling updates through core components such as Pods, Services, and Deployments. Declarative configuration enables unified management of environments and resources, reduces manual intervention, and ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments. This simplifies the deployment process, improves application stability, and promotes container image management and DevOps collaboration.

Implementation steps: containerize the application; deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster; integrate CI/CD to achieve automated building and release. Typical scenarios include blue-green deployment and elastic scaling. Business values include shortening release cycles, reducing operational costs, improving resource utilization, and enhancing fault recovery capabilities.
