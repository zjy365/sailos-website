  "content": "In cloud-native environments, service discovery is a key mechanism for dynamically managing microservice communication, ensuring that instances are automatically located and connected. Its importance lies in handling instance changes during elastic scaling, eliminating manual IP configuration, and improving system reliability and scalability. Application scenarios include implementing load balancing, failover, and continuous deployment in container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes.\n\nCore components include service registries (e.g., Etcd or Consul), instance registration mechanisms, and health check processes. The principle is based on pods automatically registering metadata when starting up, with clients querying available instances via DNS or APIs, supporting load balancing strategies. In practical applications, Kubernetes' Service resource abstracts backend endpoints and integrates with CoreDNS to implement domain name resolution, significantly reducing network errors and improving high availability.\n\nImplementation steps include: defining Kubernetes Service resources and setting pod selectors, with backend endpoints updated automatically; clients accessing services using DNS names. A typical scenario is achieving zero-downtime updates and elastic scaling in microservice deployments. Business values include reducing operational complexity, accelerating development iterations, improving system resilience, and enhancing resource utilization."
