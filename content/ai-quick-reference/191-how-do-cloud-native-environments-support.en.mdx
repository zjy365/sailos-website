Cloud-native environments provide foundational support for hybrid cloud deployments through features such as containerization, microservices architecture, and declarative APIs. Their core value lies in masking differences in underlying infrastructure, enabling consistent deployment and management of applications across public cloud, private cloud, or edge environments, and meeting hybrid cloud core requirements such as resource optimization, compliance, and business elasticity.

Core supports include: Kubernetes as a unified orchestration layer, centrally scheduling cross-cloud workloads through cluster federation (e.g., KubeFed) or multi-cluster management tools; service meshes (e.g., Istio) enabling transparent communication and governance of cross-cloud services; DevOps pipelines and GitOps practices ensuring cross-cloud consistency of configurations and policies; immutable infrastructure and automated运维 reducing the risk of environment discrepancies. These features enable applications to dynamically migrate, scale, and achieve fault isolation.

The implementation path is: 1. Adopt a unified Kubernetes management plane to integrate hybrid clusters; 2. Build cross-cloud network and security policies based on service meshes; 3. Implement multi-environment automated releases through CI/CD toolchains; 4. Deploy multi-cloud monitoring and log aggregation. The resulting business values include avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities, accelerating innovation iterations (e.g., edge computing scenarios), while optimizing cost and compliance control.
