In cloud-native data management, automated architecture migration refers to the use of automated tools to seamlessly transfer data storage and access architectures to target environments such as cross-cloud or containerized platforms. Its importance lies in improving migration efficiency, ensuring data consistency and business continuity, and it is applicable to scenarios such as cloud environment optimization, data warehouse upgrades, and multi-cloud strategies.

Core components include declarative configuration frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes Operators), dedicated migration tools (e.g., AWS Database Migration Service or Velero), and integrated CI/CD pipelines; features involve automated testing, rollback mechanisms, and continuous monitoring. In practical applications, this simplifies data model upgrades (e.g., from monolithic to distributed databases), reduces migration risks, and enhances system resilience and scalability. The impact is to accelerate cloud-native transformation and support agile iteration.

Implementation steps: Assess the source environment and design a migration plan; integrate automated tools (e.g., Terraform scripts) to perform data replication; test and verify data integrity; and finally deploy and monitor. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud platform migration or microservice evolution. The business value lies in cost savings, improved reliability, and optimized resource utilization, making it suitable for large-scale modernization projects.
