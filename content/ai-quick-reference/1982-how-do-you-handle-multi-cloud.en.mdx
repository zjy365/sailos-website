Cloud-native applications are based on containerization and microservice design, supporting elastic scaling and automated deployment. Multi-cloud integration enables unified resource management across multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure), improving high availability and avoiding vendor lock-in risks, suitable for disaster recovery, global load balancing, and compliance scenarios.

Core components include Kubernetes Cluster Federation for resource coordination, service meshes (such as Istio) to ensure cross-cloud communication security, and API gateways for traffic routing. This solution standardizes infrastructure interfaces, builds hybrid cloud environments in practical applications, and optimizes costs while enhancing business continuity through unified monitoring and elastic scaling.

Implementation steps: standardize application deployment and use Terraform to manage multi-cloud configurations; deploy service meshes to connect microservices; integrate API management and CI/CD pipelines; use monitoring tools such as Prometheus for unified operation and maintenance. A typical scenario is the global deployment of e-commerce platforms, bringing business values including high availability, cost savings, and flexible scalability.
