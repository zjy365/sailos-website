The core of cloud-native data management integrated with Kubernetes lies in achieving persistence, migration, and protection of data for containerized stateful applications through standardized interfaces and automation mechanisms. Its importance lies in addressing the issue that traditional storage cannot adapt to dynamic scheduling and scaling of containers, supporting the elastic operation of critical businesses such as databases and message queues on Kubernetes, and is suitable for microservice architectures, DevOps pipelines, and hybrid cloud scenarios.

Core components include CSI (Container Storage Interface) drivers that provide standardized block/file storage access; the Operator pattern (such as Postgres Operator) that automates the deployment, backup, and scaling of database clusters; and data backup/recovery tools (such as Velero) that enable disaster recovery of cluster states and persistent volumes. These components allow data volumes to migrate across nodes with Pods, ensure high availability, and simplify lifecycle management through declarative APIs.

Implementation steps: First, deploy CSI drivers for cloud providers (such as AWS EBS CSI) or distributed storage (such as Ceph RBD), and define provisioning policies in StorageClass; second, deploy stateful applications through Operator or StatefulSet, and associate PVC/PV for automatic storage provisioning; finally, configure Velero to regularly back up PVC and application states. Typical scenarios include running MySQL clusters or real-time data warehouses on K8s, with business values of achieving automated operation and maintenance, reducing storage costs, and enabling cross-cloud data portability.
