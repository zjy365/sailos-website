In a microservices architecture, logging involves collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from multiple independent services. Its importance lies in supporting fault diagnosis, performance monitoring, and security auditing in distributed systems. Application scenarios include tracing request flows, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring compliance to avoid system blind spots.

Core components include structured log formats (such as JSON), log aggregation tools (such as the EFK stack: Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana), and distributed trace IDs to correlate cross-service calls. By ensuring log consistency, searchability, and efficient querying, this enhances system observability, significantly reduces debugging time, and impacts overall operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Define a unified log format; 2. Deploy log collection agents (such as Fluentd); 3. Aggregate to storage platforms (such as Elasticsearch); 4. Analyze using visualization tools. Typical scenarios include deployment in Kubernetes environments. Business value: Enhances system reliability, reduces MTTR, and optimizes costs.
