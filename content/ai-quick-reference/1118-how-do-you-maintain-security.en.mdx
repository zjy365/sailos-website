Hybrid cloud infrastructure integrates public and private cloud resources, offering flexibility and cost efficiency, which is crucial in modern environments. It is suitable for application scenarios where enterprise data is sensitive or globally distributed, such as business expansion in financial services and e-commerce.

The core of its security maintenance includes unified identity management (e.g., IAM), end-to-end data encryption, and network micro-segmentation. Based on the zero-trust model (always verify), it ensures cross-cloud data flow and access control. Practical applications can address compliance requirements such as GDPR, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and improving the reliability of the overall cloud architecture.

Implementation steps include: first, assessing risks and compliance gaps; second, formulating unified strategies and deploying tools such as Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) for continuous monitoring; and finally, conducting regular audits. Typical scenarios include multi-cloud data sharing, and business values involve reducing the probability of violations, enhancing agility, and supporting cost optimization.
