Network latency refers to the response time of data transmission, and bottlenecks are performance limitations. Monitoring these in cloud-native systems is crucial to ensure reliable communication between microservices and avoid service disruptions. Application scenarios include containerized microservice architectures, enhancing user experience and application responsiveness.

The core components include distributed tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger), metrics collection systems (e.g., Prometheus), and network performance dashboards. The principle relies on end-to-end tracing, bandwidth and packet loss rate metrics analysis. In practical applications, it can identify inter-Pod latency hotspots in real-time, optimize routing through service mesh, and significantly improve system throughput and fault tolerance.

Implementation steps: Deploy service mesh like Istio to integrate tracing; configure Prometheus to collect network metrics; set up alerts and Grafana visualization; regularly analyze data to mitigate bottlenecks. Business values include reducing downtime risks, optimizing resource utilization, and lowering operational costs.
