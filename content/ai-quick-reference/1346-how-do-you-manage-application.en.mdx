In CI/CD pipelines, application configuration management refers to handling environment-related settings (such as database URLs or keys) to ensure deployment consistency and security. Its importance lies in automating software delivery, reducing human errors, and being applied in DevOps and cloud-native environments (such as Kubernetes clusters) to support rapid iteration and reliable releases.

Core methods include separating configuration from code, using version control tools (such as Git to store YAML files) and configuration management principles (such as environment isolation through dev/prod parameterization). Features involve encrypting sensitive data (with tools like Secrets or Vault), version tracking, and dynamic injection. In practical applications, integrating CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI) in containerized deployments (such as Helm Charts) automates configuration updates to enhance reliability and efficiency in handling multiple environments.

Implementation steps: 1. Store configurations in a version control repository. 2. Automatically validate and apply configurations during the CI phase. 3. Deploy to the target environment during the CD phase. Typical scenarios handle dev/test/prod differences, and business values include accelerating release cycles, reducing deployment risks, and improving compliance.
