  "content": "Popular tools in cloud-native environments mainly include container orchestration platforms, CI/CD pipeline tools, microservice governance and service mesh solutions, monitoring and logging solutions, etc. They are the core support for achieving elasticity, observability, automation, and agile delivery, and are widely used in the lifecycle of microservice application construction, deployment, and operation and maintenance.\n\nCore tools include: Kubernetes (the de facto standard for container orchestration), Docker (the foundation of container runtime). In the CI/CD field, there are Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Argo CD (GitOps practice). For monitoring and logging, Prometheus (metric collection), Grafana (visualization), Loki (log aggregation), and the ELK stack are adopted. Istio or Linkerd (service mesh) are commonly used for service governance. Image registries such as Harbor. Helm is used for package management, and Envoy serves as a service proxy. These tools work together to build a scalable, self-healing, and automated application platform.\n\nThese tools have greatly improved development and operation efficiency, supporting continuous deployment (from monthly to minute-level), enabling fault self-healing, optimizing resource utilization, and ensuring application elasticity. Key business values include: accelerating product iteration (automated CI/CD), enhancing system stability (monitoring, alerting, and self-healing), and strengthening security (service mesh policies), ultimately forming an efficient and reliable closed-loop delivery of cloud-native applications."
