Cloud-native application lifecycle management refers to the coordination of the entire process of microservices from building and deployment to operation and maintenance using automated tools and platforms. It is particularly important in microservice architectures due to the large number of services, complex dependencies, and the need for rapid iteration, which requires ensuring stability, scalability, and continuity. It is suitable for business scenarios with high-frequency releases.

It corely depends on CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration (such as Kubernetes), service meshes (such as Istio), and observability tools (monitoring, logging, tracing). It adopts declarative configuration and GitOps practices to achieve rolling updates of services, automatic scaling, health checks, and fault self-healing. Kubernetes abstracts orchestration details through resource objects such as Deployment and Service, while service meshes handle inter-service communication governance. This automated mechanism significantly increases deployment frequency and reduces human errors.

Practical operation steps: 1) Containerize microservices; 2) Establish a CI pipeline to build images; 3) Use CD tools (such as Argo CD) to deploy declaratively to the K8s cluster; 4) Configure the service mesh for traffic management (canary releases, circuit breaking); 5) Use monitoring and alerting to drive operational decisions. Its business value lies in accelerating the delivery cycle, improving system resilience, and reducing change risks through progressive releases to achieve efficient large-scale operation and maintenance.
