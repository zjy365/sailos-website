  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, security protects data and access control, while performance monitoring tracks resource utilization and latency; the collaboration between the two is key to ensuring reliable system operation, especially in highly dynamic applications such as microservices and container orchestration, which can prevent service disruptions caused by security vulnerabilities.\n\nCore components include security tools (such as vulnerability scanner Trivy) and monitoring tools (such as Prometheus and Grafana), which achieve unified log, metric, and alert management through integration frameworks like Kubernetes Operators. It features real-time analysis and automated response, promoting a DevSecOps culture; in Kubernetes clusters, service meshes (such as Istio) combined with application performance monitoring directly impact operational efficiency, reducing misconfigurations and attack surfaces.\n\nImplementation steps: First, integrate platforms (such as using OpenTelemetry to collect metrics); second, define collaborative strategies, such as security incidents triggering performance threshold alerts; finally, automate remediation, such as isolating infected Pods to improve resilience. Typical scenarios include real-time optimization in CI/CD pipelines, with business values of enhancing availability, reducing operational costs, and meeting compliance requirements."
