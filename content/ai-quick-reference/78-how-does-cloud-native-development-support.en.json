  "content": "Cloud-native development emphasizes application building methods based on cloud environments (such as containers, microservices, and continuous delivery), supports containerized database management, provides portability, elasticity, and efficient resource utilization, and is suitable for database deployment and operation in microservice architectures.\n\nIts core utilizes Kubernetes to orchestrate database containers, enabling automated deployment, dynamic scaling, and self-healing functions, and combines DevOps toolchains to simplify configuration and monitoring; this improves database reliability and agility, supports stateless and stateful applications (such as PostgreSQL or Redis containers), reduces operational complexity, and accelerates update cycles.\n\nImplementation steps include: containerizing database images, deploying clusters via Kubernetes, and using the operator pattern to manage persistent storage and backups; typical scenarios include integrating CI/CD pipelines to implement blue-green deployments or rolling updates, with business values lying in cost savings, enhanced elasticity, and accelerated innovation response."
