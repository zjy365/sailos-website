  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools allow defining and configuring infrastructure resources using declarative or imperative code. Their importance lies in directly embedding security policies (such as network rules, access controls, and compliance baselines) into infrastructure definitions, enabling automated, repeatable, and consistent secure deployments. Application scenarios include continuously building secure and compliant VPCs, virtual machine clusters, databases, and service configurations.\n\nThe core is writing security policies as code and integrating them with infrastructure definitions. For example, defining security group rules in Terraform to restrict inbound traffic, and configuring the least privilege principle for IAM roles in CloudFormation templates. Features include version control, code reviews to ensure the correctness of security policies, and automated deployment pipelines to enforce security configurations, avoiding manual configuration errors or omissions.\n\nKey steps:\n\n1. Establish security baselines: Define security and compliance requirement standards (e.g., CIS benchmarks).\n\n2. Select tools and write code: Use tools like Terraform and AWS CDK to write infrastructure code embedded with security policies (such as encrypted buckets, firewall rules restricting ports).\n\n3. Integrate static scanning: Use tools like Checkov and tfsec in the CI pipeline to check if the code complies with security policies before deployment.\n\n4. Automated deployment and testing: Automatically deploy infrastructure through CI/CD pipelines and run dynamic security tests after deployment.\n\n5. Audit and governance: Use IaC state management and tool-generated audit logs to track configuration changes and compliance status. Business value lies in improving security posture, accelerating compliance audits, and reducing the risk of human errors."
