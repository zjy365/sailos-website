  "content": "An automated deployment pipeline is an automated process of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) used to accelerate software releases. Supporting a multi-cloud strategy can enhance enterprise resilience, avoid vendor lock-in, and improve resource optimization, applicable to hybrid cloud environments such as scenarios where AWS and Azure run in parallel.\n\nIts core includes build, test, and deployment phases, managing multi-cloud resource characteristics through abstraction tools like Terraform or Jenkins. In practical applications, it ensures consistent cross-cloud configurations, reduces human errors, and supports business continuity and elastic scaling requirements.\n\nImplementation steps include defining unified workflows, adopting Infrastructure as Code to abstract cloud interfaces, and adding cross-cloud test validation. Typical scenarios include failover deployment, with business value such as accelerating release speed by over 50% and reducing operational risks."
