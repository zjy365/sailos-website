Monitoring of cloud-native applications involves tracking performance metrics, logs, and distributed tracing to ensure system health and observability; this is crucial in large-scale environments for real-time fault detection, performance optimization, and maintenance of service reliability, applied in microservice architectures and highly dynamic cloud platforms such as e-commerce peak load scenarios.

The core components include metrics (resource utilization), logs (event records), and tracing (request chains), with features such as scalability, automated collection, and real-time analysis; integrated into the Kubernetes ecosystem through tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger, they provide end-to-end visibility in practical applications, reducing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and improving system availability.

During implementation, standardized processes are adopted: deploying Prometheus for metric collection, configuring the EFK stack for log management, and implementing OpenTelemetry for unified tracing; automated alerting and AI analysis handle typical fault scenarios, with business values including reducing downtime costs, enhancing user experience, and supporting data-driven decision-making for business growth.
