  "content": "In cloud-native applications, state management handles data persistence such as user sessions or databases, ensuring data consistency and reliability when applications scale elastically. Its importance lies in avoiding failures caused by state loss. Application scenarios include distributed databases under microservice architectures, caching systems, and event stream processing, supporting rapid failure recovery.\n\nCore components include distributed storage systems (e.g., Redis, Cassandra), container orchestration tools like Kubernetes StatefulSets, as well as Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC). Features include horizontal scalability, automatic data replication, and strong consistency mechanisms; the principle is based on the CAP theorem to balance consistency and availability. In practical applications, StatefulSets deploy stateful services, combined with service meshes to implement state access, enhancing elasticity and data integrity, which affects overall system performance.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Identify state requirements such as transaction data; 2. Select appropriate storage such as cloud-hosted databases; 3. Use StatefulSets to create stateful Pods; 4. Configure PV and backup strategies; 5. Integrate monitoring and automatic recovery. A typical scenario is e-commerce order processing, with business values of improving high availability, reducing costs, and optimizing user experience."
