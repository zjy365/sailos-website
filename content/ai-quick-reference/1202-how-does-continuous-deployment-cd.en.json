  "content": "Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, automatically executing builds and tests to ensure code quality; its importance lies in accelerating the feedback loop and reducing integration errors, applied in agile development and DevOps processes. Continuous Deployment (CD) refers to automatically releasing validated code to the production environment after CI is completed, focusing on the automated deployment phase; its importance is to shorten the release cycle and reduce risks, commonly used to support cloud-native applications with high-frequency updates.\n\nThe core components of CI include version control triggers, automated testing, and rapid feedback mechanisms, emphasizing error prevention during the code integration phase; CD relies on deployment pipelines and release strategies to achieve seamless flow from the testing environment to production. The key difference between the two: CI mainly handles development and integration, while CD focuses on release and operations. Together, they form a continuous delivery pipeline, significantly improving team efficiency and software reliability.\n\nIn application, CI is used to promote team collaboration and code stability, with the value of increasing development speed; CD is used to achieve instant delivery and innovative iteration, with the value of accelerating time-to-market and business responsiveness."
