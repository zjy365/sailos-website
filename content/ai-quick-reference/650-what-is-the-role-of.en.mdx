A key-value store is a data storage model that uses unique keys to associate and retrieve corresponding values. It is crucial in cloud-native data management, specifically designed to handle large-scale, high-throughput, and low-latency scenarios, especially suitable for dynamic, unstructured, or semi-structured data such as configuration management, session storage, feature flags, and service discovery in microservice architectures.

Its core features include a simple key-value data model, extremely high read-write performance, horizontal scalability, and often support for TTL (Time-To-Live) automatic expiration. As a lightweight NoSQL database, it is naturally adapted to distributed environments. In cloud-native contexts, it separates the application's state (stored in the key-value store) from computation (handled by stateless containers), significantly enhancing application resilience, scalability, and deployment flexibility. It is vital for achieving loose coupling between services.

The main application values of key-value stores are: 1) Centralized configuration management: acting as a configuration center, where services dynamically pull configurations at startup without requiring restarts for updates; 2) Session state sharing: maintaining user sessions across load-balanced service instances; 3) Lightweight caching: accelerating data access; 4) Service discovery registry: storing service address information for dynamic discovery; 5) Feature toggle management. Its implementation simplifies distributed state management, reduces complexity, and supports the rapid iteration and reliability of microservices.
