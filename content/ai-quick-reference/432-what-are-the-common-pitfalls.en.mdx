Microservices architecture is a development approach that decomposes applications into small independent services, enhancing system flexibility and scalability, suitable for e-commerce and high-concurrency cloud application scenarios. Avoiding implementation pitfalls such as improper granularity or lack of monitoring is crucial to ensuring maintainability and performance.

Core pitfalls include overly fine-grained services leading to operational complexity, increased network communication failures causing latency, lack of unified monitoring affecting troubleshooting, and challenges in distributed transaction processing. These pitfalls significantly increase system vulnerability, leading to decreased reliability and efficiency.

Avoiding pitfalls strengthens system robustness, accelerates deployment and iteration, and enhances business agility and user experience value by optimizing service boundaries and adopting circuit breaker mechanisms.
