A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that manages communication between distributed services, ensuring the security and reliability of data transmission. In cloud-native systems, protecting communication channels is crucial as it prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and man-in-the-middle attacks. It is suitable for critical scenarios in microservice architectures such as financial services and e-commerce, to enhance overall security and compliance.

The core components include the data plane (e.g., Sidecar proxies handling traffic) and the control plane (managing configurations). Features involve mutual TLS (mTLS) for bidirectional authentication and encryption, and fine-grained policies such as RBAC authorization. The principle is to automate security rules through proxies. In practical applications, it implements a zero-trust security model, reduces the attack surface, and enhances observability and monitoring capabilities. Its impact on the cloud-native domain is providing end-to-end security guarantees and resilient communication.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy a service mesh (e.g., Istio or Linkerd), 2. Configure mTLS to enable service authentication, 3. Define access policies such as restricting network scope, 4. Integrate identity management to monitor traffic. Typical scenarios include protecting API communication in hybrid cloud environments. Business values are reducing security risks, meeting compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR), improving system reliability, and lowering costs.
