  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, data version control refers to tracking versions of datasets, configuration files, database schemas, etc., through codified management to ensure environmental consistency, auditability, and rapid rollback capabilities. It is crucial for supporting CI/CD processes, compliance requirements (such as GDPR), and multi-team collaboration under microservice architectures, and is applied in scenarios like disaster recovery and experimental releases.\n\nIt is core-based on GitOps principles, using Git repositories as the single source of truth to store declarative configurations (such as Kubernetes YAML files or Terraform scripts). Tools like Flux CD or Argo CD monitor repository changes and automatically synchronize them to clusters, reducing configuration drift through a pull model. Features include branch strategies for environment isolation, immutable storage, and automatic rollbacks, providing end-to-end observability and reducing the risk of production incidents.\n\nImplementation steps are: 1. Define configurations and data as code and commit them to a Git repository; 2. Deploy a GitOps controller (such as Flux) to monitor the repository and interact with the Kubernetes API; 3. Use Git tags/branches to manage different versions and trigger automatic deployments or rollbacks. Typical scenarios include blue-green deployments and A/B testing. Business values are accelerating secure releases (reducing deployment time by 50%), ensuring compliance audit traceability, and lowering operational costs."
