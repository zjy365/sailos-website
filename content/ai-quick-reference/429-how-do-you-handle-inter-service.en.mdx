Inter-service communication refers to the way microservices exchange data or requests, which is the core of distributed architecture, ensuring independent deployment and smooth collaboration of services. Its importance lies in achieving scalability and elasticity, and it is commonly used in scenarios such as e-commerce order processing and financial transactions.

The core components include synchronous communication (such as HTTP/gRPC) and asynchronous communication (such as message queues), characterized by decoupling and high availability. In practical applications, service meshes (such as Istio) or API gateways are used to manage routing, and circuit breakers are used to handle faults, improving system reliability and operational efficiency, and reducing the impact of single-point bottlenecks.

How to implement: First, select a protocol (such as RESTful APIs), integrate service discovery to locate service endpoints, and implement a circuit breaker mechanism for fault tolerance; typical scenarios involve inventory updates or payment verification, bringing business values such as rapid iteration, high elastic scaling, and reduced maintenance costs.
