  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the management and configuration of infrastructure resources through code. Serverless architecture eliminates server management, allowing developers to focus solely on business logic. Its importance lies in enhancing reliability, agility, and cost efficiency. Application scenarios include cloud-native event-driven applications, such as API gateway and function computing deployments.\n\nCore components: IaC tools like Terraform define resource declarations; serverless services like AWS Lambda enable automatic scaling. The principle is based on declarative code to ensure consistent deployments. In practical applications, configuring functions, triggers, and storage components automates processes, reduces human errors, accelerates innovation cycles, and optimizes resource utilization.\n\nImplementation steps: Select an IaC tool (e.g., CloudFormation), write YAML/JSON definition files, and integrate CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment. A typical scenario is the automated setup of API gateways. Business values include reduced operational costs, improved deployment speed (in minutes), and enhanced system resilience."
