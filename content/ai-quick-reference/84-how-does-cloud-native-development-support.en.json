  "content": "Cloud-native development inherently supports Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) through containerization, microservices, and dynamic orchestration. EDA decouples communication between services, where service execution is triggered by events rather than direct invocation. In cloud-native environments, this enables higher resilience, scalability, and agility, making it particularly suitable for real-time data processing, microservice integration, and state change response scenarios (e.g., IoT, transaction processing).\n\nIts core support is reflected in: 1) Serverless/FaaS (such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions): Acting as lightweight event processors that automatically scale on-demand to respond to events; 2) Elastic scaling: Based on event throughput (e.g., KEDA automatically scales workloads in Kubernetes); 3) Cloud-native message/stream middleware (such as Kafka, NATS, Cloud Pub/Sub): Providing reliable, high-performance event delivery, storage, and replay; 4) Service mesh/API gateway: Assisting in event routing and policy management. Events become the primary asynchronous communication mechanism between microservices.\n\nImplementation steps typically include: 1) Deploying a message broker (e.g., Kafka) in the cluster; 2) Developing event producer services (sensing state changes and publishing events); 3) Developing event consumers using Serverless or containers; 4) Configuring elastic scaling rules (e.g., KEDA scaling consumers based on message queue depth); 5) Integrating observability tools to monitor event streams. This significantly reduces system coupling, enhances adaptability to traffic fluctuations, and accelerates development and deployment speed."
