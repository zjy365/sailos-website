Infrastructure as Code (IaC) script reusability allows deploying the same infrastructure configuration across environments such as development, testing, and production. It minimizes manual effort, ensures consistency, and accelerates deployments, vital for cloud-native applications in CI/CD pipelines and multi-cloud scenarios.

Core features include parameterization for dynamic inputs, modular design with reusable components, and environment abstraction layers. By decoupling configuration from code and using tools like Terraform modules or AWS CloudFormation, it automates scaling and maintains resource uniformity, enhancing DevOps efficiency and reducing operational risks in agile projects.

Implement steps: 1. Parameterize key values like resource sizes. 2. Structure scripts into modular units. 3. Abstract environment-specific settings via configuration files. 4. Integrate version control for collaboration. 5. Validate with cross-environment testing. This supports scalable deployments, lowers costs, and speeds releases in scenarios like infrastructure provisioning, delivering reliability and business agility.
