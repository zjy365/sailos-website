Multi-cloud deployment refers to hosting applications using multiple cloud service providers, and cost optimization is a strategy to reduce expenses and improve resource efficiency. Its importance lies in avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing redundancy and availability, and it is applied in globally distributed businesses to reduce risks and utilize optimal prices.

The core includes resource monitoring, automated scaling, and integration tools such as Kubernetes for cross-cloud management. Features involve dynamic load distribution and price difference analysis, with the principle based on intelligently optimizing workload deployment. Practical applications analyze cost data through multi-cloud platforms, reduce redundant resources, enhance flexibility, and minimize waste, significantly impacting ROI and operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Audit existing costs and usage. 2. Deploy auto-scaling strategies to adjust resources on demand. 3. Adopt multi-cloud management tools such as CloudHealth or Kubernetes cluster optimization. Typical scenarios include migrating workflows to low-cost clouds during peak times. Business value includes saving up to 30% of costs, improving availability and agility.
