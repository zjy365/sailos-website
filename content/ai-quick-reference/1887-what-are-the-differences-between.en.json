  "content": "Cloud-native application architecture is a modern approach designed specifically for cloud environments, emphasizing microservices, containerization, and automation to enhance agility and scalability. It is widely applied in cloud platforms such as AWS or Kubernetes clusters. In contrast, traditional application architecture is typically monolithic or vertically scalable, deployed on on-premises physical servers, and relies on manual operations. The significance of cloud-native lies in optimizing resource utilization and responding to dynamic load changes, making it suitable for real-time online services and distributed system scenarios.\n\nIts core characteristics include microservice decoupling, container encapsulation (e.g., Docker), and Kubernetes orchestration for elastic scaling and service meshes. The underlying principles are based on DevOps culture and continuous deployment. In practical applications, for example, e-commerce platforms adopt microservice architectures to automatically handle high concurrency. The impact is driving rapid iteration, improving fault tolerance, reducing maintenance costs, and significantly enhancing application performance and reliability.\n\nThe application value is reflected in efficient resource scheduling and rapid fault recovery. The values include cost reduction, enhanced business resilience, and support for agile innovation, such as enabling seamless scaling and high-availability service delivery in fintech or media sectors."
