CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. Ensuring its integrity through automated checks prevents incorrect deployments, improves software quality and reliability, and is crucial in cloud-native development and containerized environments for efficient delivery and运维 scenarios.

Core components include unit testing, integration testing, static code analysis, and security scanning. These tools are executed automatically at various stages of the pipeline, such as running test frameworks after code submission to provide immediate feedback and reduce manual intervention. The principle is based on integrating tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI to ensure timely validation of code changes, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of failures.

Implementation steps: Integrate testing frameworks such as JUnit; configure code style linters and SonarQube scanning; add security checks and monitoring alerts. A typical scenario is triggering tests upon code submission. Business value: Reduces deployment failure rates, accelerates release cycles, and supports agile innovation.
