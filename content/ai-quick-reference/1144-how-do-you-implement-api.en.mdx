In a multi-cloud environment, an API gateway serves as a centralized entry point for managing API requests, responsible for routing, security, and traffic control, supporting cross-cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. Its importance lies in simplifying the integration of complex multi-cloud architectures, enhancing availability and security, and it is commonly used in global application deployments and hybrid cloud scenarios to unify service exposure.

The core components include a dynamic routing engine, authentication and authorization modules (e.g., OAuth), monitoring and logging systems, with features of multi-cloud compatibility and elastic scaling. In practical applications, it abstracts the location of backend services, implements load balancing and unified policies; its impacts include reducing development complexity, strengthening cross-cloud security governance, and it is suitable for the multi-cloud distribution of microservice architectures.

Implementation steps: 1) Select compatible tools such as Kong or Apigee; 2) Deploy redundant gateway instances across various clouds; 3) Configure routing policies and API definitions; 4) Integrate monitoring and automated testing. A typical scenario is a multi-cloud microservice architecture, with business values including cost optimization, fault isolation, and vendor flexibility.
