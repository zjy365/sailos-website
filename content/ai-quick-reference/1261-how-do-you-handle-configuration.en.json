  "content": "In CI/CD pipelines, configuration management refers to the practice of separating application environment settings, connection strings, keys, and other parameters from code and managing them automatically. Its core goals are to ensure environment consistency, enhance deployment reliability, and enable security auditing.\n\nCore practices include: 1) Version control: All configurations (such as environment variable files, Kubernetes manifests) are stored in a dedicated Git repository, isolated from application code but versionable in correlation; 2) Environment abstraction: Using templating (Helm/Kustomize) or external configuration services (e.g., Consul) to inject environment-specific parameters; 3) Secret management: Encrypting sensitive information with Vault/KMS/sealed-secrets, only injecting securely at runtime or deployment time; 4) Immutable configuration: Generating a new version of configuration for each change to avoid manual modifications in the production environment.\n\nA typical workflow is: 1) Modify the configuration repository and submit a PR to trigger the pipeline; 2) CI phase verifies configuration syntax and application compatibility; 3) CD phase renders the final configuration based on the target environment (e.g., Helm install --values) and injects secrets securely; 4) Deploy the rendered configuration bound to the application version; 5) Verify the effectiveness of the configuration after deployment. This workflow ensures traceability, rollback capability, and cross-environment consistency of configuration changes, significantly reducing the \"\"environment drift\"\" issue."
