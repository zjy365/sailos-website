Cloud-native development ensures application scalability (dynamically responding to load changes) and fault tolerance (maintaining operation during failures) through modern cloud technologies, enhancing system reliability and resource efficiency. It is suitable for high-traffic scenarios such as e-commerce and financial transactions.

Core components include microservices architecture (decoupled services), containerization (Docker), and orchestration tools (Kubernetes), featuring automated deployment, load balancing, and health checks. Its principles utilize redundant resources and intelligent scheduling to achieve elastic scaling, and enhance fault tolerance through failover mechanisms. In practical applications, it promotes agile iteration and business continuity, reducing downtime risks.

Implementation steps include: 1. Designing the architecture as microservices; 2. Using container orchestration to manage resources; 3. Configuring auto-scaling policies; 4. Deploying fault detection and recovery mechanisms. This optimizes costs, improves user experience, ensures business continuity, and is suitable for online services and critical application scenarios.
