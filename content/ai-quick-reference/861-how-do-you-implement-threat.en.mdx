Implementing threat detection in cloud-native environments is critical for ensuring the security of dynamic, distributed applications. Due to the ephemeral nature of their infrastructure (containers, Kubernetes), complex communication between microservices, and high degree of automation, which bring new attack surfaces and challenges that traditional tools struggle to adapt to, it serves as a core pillar of DevSecOps.

The core lies in adopting a cloud-native specialized toolchain: utilizing CNI plugins such as Cilium or Calico to enforce network policy monitoring; deploying security scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair) for image vulnerability checks; configuring Kubernetes audit logs and enabling runtime security tools (e.g., Falco) to monitor abnormal process/file activities; integrating service meshes (e.g., Istio) to enforce fine-grained security controls; incorporating Kubernetes-native resources (e.g., OPA Gatekeeper) to enforce configuration compliance baselines; and implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning. All data needs to be centralized in a SIEM (e.g., Elastic Security) for correlation analysis.

Implementation steps: First, integrate image and IaC scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to block high-risk deployments; deploy Agents (e.g., Falco DaemonSet) in the Kubernetes cluster and configure alert rules; enable Kubernetes audit log and network policy log collection; establish SIEM centralized analysis and set up automated responses (e.g., pausing abnormal Pods); implement a zero-trust framework; conduct regular threat hunting and configuration audits. This solution significantly improves the response speed to malicious activities, reduces risks such as container escape and credential theft, and meets compliance requirements.
