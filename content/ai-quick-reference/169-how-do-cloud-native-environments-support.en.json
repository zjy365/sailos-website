  "content": "Cloud-native environments utilize technologies such as containerization and Kubernetes to enable agile deployment and elastic management of applications; edge computing pushes processing to the source of data to reduce latency and bandwidth consumption. The combination of the two is crucial, as it can meet real-time requirements and is widely applied in scenarios such as IoT monitoring and autonomous driving.\n\nIts core includes lightweight Kubernetes distributions (e.g., K3s) and container orchestration, providing distributed self-healing and elastic scaling capabilities. In principle, it extends cloud-native architecture to edge devices, supporting local data analysis and decision-making. In practical applications, such as optimizing response time in industrial automation, it enhances system reliability, reduces cloud dependency, and significantly improves performance.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy lightweight Kubernetes clusters to edge nodes; containerize applications; integrate CI/CD pipelines. Typical scenarios include real-time analysis in smart retail. Business values include reducing bandwidth costs, improving response speed, supporting offline operations, thereby optimizing user experience and service continuity."
