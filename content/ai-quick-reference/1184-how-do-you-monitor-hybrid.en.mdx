Hybrid cloud security monitoring refers to the process of detecting cyber threats in public and private cloud environments, ensuring cross-cloud data protection, compliance, and business continuity. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and attacks, and applicable scenarios include daily security operations and risk management in enterprise hybrid cloud deployments.

Core components include log management systems (such as SIEM platforms), network traffic analysis tools, and intrusion detection systems; features involve real-time monitoring, cross-platform integration, and automated response, using behavioral analysis to identify anomalies. In practical applications, a unified visualization interface is used to enhance the security posture and reduce the impact of non-compliance incidents, such as integration with cloud-native tools like AWS GuardDuty.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate logs from all cloud environments into a central monitoring platform. 2. Deploy tools for real-time analysis and automated alerts. 3. Regularly perform vulnerability scans and audits. Typical scenarios include monitoring during hybrid cloud migration, and business values lie in reducing security risks, improving compliance, and optimizing operational efficiency.
