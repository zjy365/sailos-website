In a microservices architecture, monitoring network traffic and service interactions is crucial for ensuring system reliability, performance optimization, and troubleshooting. This supports efficient microservice communication, especially in preventing service disruptions in cloud-native applications and Kubernetes environments.

Core components include service meshes (e.g., Istio), metrics collection tools (e.g., Prometheus), distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger), and logging systems (e.g., ELK Stack). They collect latency, error rate, and traffic data in real time, enabling request tracing and performance analysis, which significantly enhances operational visibility and anomaly detection capabilities.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy service mesh proxies to capture traffic; 2. Configure metrics collectors; 3. Integrate tracing tools; 4. Set up visualization dashboards. Typical scenarios include service latency monitoring or A/B testing, with business values in improving system availability, reducing mean time to recovery, and optimizing resource efficiency.
