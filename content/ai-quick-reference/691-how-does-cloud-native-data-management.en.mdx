Cloud-native data management provides a foundational framework for complying with strict data regulations such as GDPR in dynamic microservices environments through distributed architecture, automated orchestration, and policy-driven control. Its importance lies in meeting data privacy, subject rights, minimal storage, and security requirements, applicable to global application scenarios that need to handle sensitive user information.

The core components are declarative APIs, immutable infrastructure, and policy-as-code (e.g., OPA). It offers: data location awareness and boundary control (e.g., using K8s network policies); granular access control (RBAC, ABAC); transparent audit trails; automated data lifecycle management (retention/deletion policies); and encryption by default (in transit and at rest). Service meshes (e.g., Istio) can enhance the security and observability of data flows.

Through toolchains (e.g., Vault for secret management, Velero/S3 for portable backups, Data Catalog for automatic sensitive data tagging), unified policies are enforced, automating the fulfillment of data subject requests (access, deletion) and compliance proof, significantly reducing human errors and audit costs. This provides an evidence chain for continuous compliance, lowering the risk of violations and reputational damage.
