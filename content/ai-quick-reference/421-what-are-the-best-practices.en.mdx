The best practice for building microservices is to split a monolithic application into independent, small, and loosely coupled services, each constructed around specific business capabilities. Its importance lies in enhancing agility, independent deployment and scalability, making it particularly suitable for large complex systems and scenarios requiring rapid iteration.

Core practices include: following domain-driven design to clearly define service boundaries; ensuring each service has independent deployment and data autonomy; implementing an API gateway to uniformly handle entry requests and authentication/authorization; adopting containerization technology to ensure environmental consistency; establishing a comprehensive service registration, discovery, and configuration center; implementing automated continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines; and utilizing service meshes to handle inter-service communication and resilience patterns.

Implementation steps: first, conduct detailed domain and context analysis; design services and their interaction interfaces; select an appropriate technology stack and implement containerization packaging; deploy the service mesh and API gateway; configure monitoring, logging, and alerting systems; establish an automated CI/CD process to achieve fast and secure deployment. This ultimately improves development efficiency, system resilience, and business response speed.
