  "content": "In cloud-native environments, security logs record events such as authentication incidents, vulnerability scan results, and abnormal access behaviors, while observability systems aggregate logs, metrics, and traces to enable comprehensive monitoring. Their integration is crucial as it enhances threat detection capabilities, supports compliance audits, and promotes DevSecOps collaboration, with application scenarios including real-time security incident response and cloud workload protection.\n\nCore components include log sources (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs and container outputs), collection agents (e.g., Fluentd or Filebeat), and aggregation platforms (e.g., Elastic Stack or Grafana). Features encompass log parsing, storage, and visualization. In practical applications, it enables historical data analysis and real-time alerting, significantly improving security posture and operational efficiency, with impacts including reducing potential attack surfaces and accelerating incident investigations.\n\nIntegration steps: Configure resources to output security logs to stdout or files; deploy agents to collect and forward them to observability platforms; set up parsing rules and alert mechanisms. Typical scenarios include continuous monitoring in CI/CD pipelines, with business values such as reducing the risk of security incidents, meeting regulatory requirements, and optimizing team response times."
