A CI/CD pipeline is an automated process for software building, testing, and deployment, aiming to accelerate code delivery and improve software quality. Performance benchmarking involves measuring key system metrics (such as response time and throughput) to establish a performance baseline. Implementing it in CI/CD is crucial, as it can prevent performance degradation caused by code updates, ensure high reliability and user experience, and is applied to frequent releases in DevOps environments such as web service or application deployment.

Its core components include performance testing tools (e.g., JMeter or Locust), CI/CD integration (via Jenkins or GitLab CI), automation scripts, and monitoring mechanisms. It is characterized by continuous operation, baseline comparison, and threshold setting. In practice, it embeds performance testing into the build or release phase to detect performance changes in real time, thereby improving software efficiency and stability, such as reducing the risk of production outages.

Implementation steps: 1) Define metrics (e.g., latency) and baselines; 2) Configure tools for load testing; 3) Integrate into the pipeline as an independent stage; 4) Automate execution and set failure thresholds to trigger alerts; 5) Analyze results for optimization and iteration. Typical scenarios include pre-production environment validation, and business values include reducing repair costs, accelerating delivery, enhancing user satisfaction, and competitive advantages.
