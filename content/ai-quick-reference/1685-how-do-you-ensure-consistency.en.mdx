Ensuring consistency between Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts and cloud infrastructure deployments is central to cloud environment management and governance. IaC defines infrastructure states through code versioning, making configurations auditable, repeatable, and predictable, avoiding manual configuration drift, and is crucial in continuous integration/delivery, multi-environment deployment, and disaster recovery.

The core lies in implementing declarative IaC frameworks (such as Terraform, CloudFormation, Crossplane) combined with GitOps workflows. All infrastructure changes must be committed through version control systems (such as Git). The deployment pipeline takes the committed IaC code as the single source of truth and automatically invokes cloud providers' APIs to converge the actual infrastructure to the desired state declared by the code, with manual overrides prohibited.

Implementation steps: 1. All infrastructure changes are made by submitting IaC code modifications via Git. 2. The CI/CD pipeline is automatically triggered to execute `terraform plan/apply` or equivalent operations in an isolated sandbox. 3. Use policy-as-code tools (such as OPA) to verify compliance before deployment. 4. After deployment, automatically verify that the infrastructure meets the expected state through smoke testing. 5. Continuously monitor and configure audit tools to detect and alert on any deviations from the committed code. This process ensures the eventual consistency, traceability, and security compliance of the infrastructure.
