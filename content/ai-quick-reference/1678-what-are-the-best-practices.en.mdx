Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure resources through code, enabling automated deployment, consistency, and reliable control. In cloud computing and containerization scenarios, it enhances resource repeatability and supports disaster recovery and environment orchestration requirements.

Core best practices include modular design to promote component reuse, version control systems (such as Git) to ensure change traceability, and integration of automated testing and code reviews to guarantee quality. These features optimize DevOps collaboration, accelerate release cycles, and reduce human errors.

Implementation steps: 1. Organize the repository into independent modules. 2. Integrate CI/CD pipelines to execute tests. 3. Apply environment isolation strategies. The value lies in improving maintainability, agility, and compliance, while reducing operational risks.
