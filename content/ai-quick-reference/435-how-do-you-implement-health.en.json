  "content": "Health checks are mechanisms for monitoring the operational status of microservices, ensuring that instances are detected and recovered in case of failure to prevent system paralysis. In a microservices architecture, they are crucial for enhancing resilience and availability, commonly used in load balancing and automatic recovery scenarios, such as controlling traffic and restarting failed containers in Kubernetes clusters.\n\nThe core components include liveness probes (checking if a container is running) and readiness probes (verifying if a service is ready to receive requests), implemented through HTTP endpoints, TCP sockets, or command execution. Their characteristics involve periodic requests and timeout settings, which affect microservice coordination: for example, abnormal statuses trigger restarts or removal from load balancing, improving the overall stability of the system.\n\nImplementation steps are: exposing a health check endpoint during development (e.g., GET /health returning a 200 status code), then configuring probes in deployment description files (e.g., setting paths, ports, and intervals for livenessProbe and readinessProbe in Kubernetes). Typical applications bring business value in auto-scaling or rolling updates, ensuring high availability, reducing downtime, and supporting zero-downtime maintenance."
