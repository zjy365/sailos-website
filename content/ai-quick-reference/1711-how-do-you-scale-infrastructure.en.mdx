Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation automate infrastructure management using declarative code. Their importance lies in enabling version control, consistency, and auditability. They are applied in large organizations to handle multi-environment, regionalized deployments, and team collaboration, ensuring efficient scaling.

The core of IaC includes features like modular configuration, state management, and automated orchestration, such as defining resources using HCL or JSON. The principle emphasizes that infrastructure should be testable and reusable assets. In practical applications, it integrates with CI/CD pipelines and cloud platforms, promoting agile development, reducing errors, and exerting a significant impact on the cloud-native ecosystem, such as automatically scaling Kubernetes clusters.

Implementation steps: 1. Select a tool (e.g., Terraform). 2. Design a modular infrastructure code repository. 3. Integrate CI/CD systems for automated deployment. 4. Strengthen RBAC permissions and monitoring mechanisms. Typical scenarios include multi-account management or elastic scaling, with business values covering improved scalability, cost optimization, and security compliance.
