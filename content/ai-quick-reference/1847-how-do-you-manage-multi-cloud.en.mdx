Multi-cloud deployment refers to extending cloud-native applications across multiple cloud provider platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), based on containerization and microservice architecture. Its importance lies in enhancing application resilience, avoiding vendor lock-in, optimizing costs and performance. Application scenarios include global service distribution and disaster recovery strategies.

Core components include Kubernetes container orchestration, service mesh (e.g., Istio) for handling cross-cloud communication, unified configuration management, and monitoring platforms. Features: consistency, elastic scaling, and fault isolation. In practical applications, it simplifies deployment by abstracting the cloud infrastructure, supports hybrid cloud environments, and significantly improves development efficiency and operational reliability.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy cross-cloud Kubernetes clusters; 2. Integrate service mesh to manage traffic; 3. Automate CI/CD pipelines; 4. Centralize monitoring and log aggregation. Business value: reduce costs, improve availability, and enhance the ability to respond to business continuity risks.
