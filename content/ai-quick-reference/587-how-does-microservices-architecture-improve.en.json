  "content": "Microservices architecture is a design approach that splits an application into independent, loosely coupled services. Its importance lies in enhancing software quality assurance through independent service deployment and fault tolerance mechanisms, making it suitable for highly scalable and complex systems such as e-commerce platforms.\n\nIts core elements include service autonomy, lightweight communication (e.g., REST API), and fault-tolerant design. Each service runs independently, supporting rapid iteration and fault isolation. It is applied in distributed systems to reduce the risk of global failures, thereby enhancing reliability and maintainability.\n\nSoftware quality assurance is improved through: 1) Service partitioning simplifies testing and maintenance; 2) Independent deployment enables quick issue resolution; 3) Integration with CI/CD automation for continuous validation. A typical scenario is fault isolation to improve stability, and the business value lies in enhancing delivery efficiency and system resilience."
