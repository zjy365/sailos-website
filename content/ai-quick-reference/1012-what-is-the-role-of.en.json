  "content": "Container orchestration systems (such as Kubernetes) provide a unified workload management plane for multi-cloud deployments. Their core value lies in shielding differences in underlying heterogeneous infrastructure, enabling consistent deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications across different cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or private clouds), thus addressing the pain points of fragmented resources and high operational complexity in multi-cloud environments.\n\nThe core role of container orchestration in multi-cloud environments is reflected in three aspects: First, through declarative configuration and API abstraction, it enables automated deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management of applications across multiple clouds; Second, it provides service discovery, network policies, load balancing, and storage orchestration capabilities to ensure interconnection, interoperability, and state consistency of cross-cloud applications; Third, by leveraging scheduling strategies (such as affinity/anti-affinity, taints and tolerations) and cluster federation, it intelligently optimizes the distribution of workloads across multiple clouds, improving resource utilization and resilience.\n\nThe core business value it brings is enhanced flexibility and disaster recovery capabilities: Enterprises can freely choose or combine cloud vendors to avoid lock-in; Application instances can be deployed across clouds to enhance high availability; Unified monitoring, logging, and policy management are achieved, significantly simplifying operations. Typical steps include: deploying Kubernetes clusters on target clouds, forming federations using tools (such as Cluster API, Karmada), publishing applications through GitOps模式, configuring cross-cloud network and storage policies, and ultimately achieving \"\"deploy once, run anywhere\"\"."
