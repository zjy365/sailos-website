Multi-cloud deployment involves running applications across multiple cloud providers to ensure resource sharing and disaster recovery capabilities. Real-time synchronization is a key mechanism for maintaining consistency of data and services across cloud environments, which is crucial for high availability, geographic expansion, and business continuity, commonly used in financial transaction systems or global SaaS platforms.

It is core-based on distributed consistency protocols such as Raft or Paxos, combined with cloud-native tools like Kubernetes federated clusters and service meshes (e.g., Istio). Features include low-latency data replication, automatic failure detection, and routing optimization, with a unified entry point via an API gateway. Practical applications support load balancing and disaster recovery, enhancing system resilience, avoiding data loss and service interruptions.

Implementation steps: First, select synchronization protocols such as etcd or Consul and deploy them on multi-cloud nodes. Second, integrate the service mesh for traffic management and configure automatic health checks. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud database replication, bringing business value such as reducing downtime risks and supporting real-time analysis, ensuring a seamless user experience.
