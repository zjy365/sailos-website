  "content": "Multi-cloud data encryption refers to the process of protecting the confidentiality of application data in a multi-cloud environment. Its importance lies in ensuring data security and meeting regulatory requirements (such as GDPR), and it is applied in enterprise business scenarios across AWS, Azure, or GCP cloud platforms.\n\nCore components include centralized key management (such as HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS services), a unified policy framework (based on API integration), and end-to-end encryption (for data at rest and in transit). Practical impacts: reducing leakage risks, simplifying multi-cloud security management, and improving consistency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Assess data sensitivity and compliance requirements. 2. Deploy a centralized key management platform. 3. Apply standardized encryption policies. 4. Monitor key usage and audit logs. Business value: enhancing data protection, reducing the cost of security incidents, and lowering compliance risks."
