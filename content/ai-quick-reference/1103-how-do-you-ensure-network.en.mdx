Hybrid cloud integrates private and public cloud resources, where network security is crucial as it ensures applications in distributed environments are protected from data breaches, unauthorized access, and attack threats. Its importance lies in maintaining data privacy and compliance, with application scenarios including risk management when enterprises deploy sensitive businesses in private clouds and extend services to public clouds.

The core components include network segmentation (such as virtual private clouds and security groups), identity and access management (IAM), encrypted transmission (TLS/SSL), and continuous monitoring tools (SIEM systems). The principle is based on the zero-trust model, which strictly authenticates all traffic. In practice, micro-segmentation technology is used to isolate application components; the impact is enhancing overall system resilience and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR.

Implementation steps: First, define a unified security policy, second, deploy edge firewalls and encryption gateways, third, integrate multi-cloud identity management, and finally, perform regular vulnerability scans and audits. A typical scenario is compliant operations in the financial or healthcare industries. The business value lies in reducing the risk of data breaches, avoiding fines, and improving business continuity.
