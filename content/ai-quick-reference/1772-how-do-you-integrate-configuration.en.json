  "content": "Configuration management tools (such as Ansible or Chef) are used to define and manage system and application settings, while Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates resource deployment through code. Integrating them ensures compliance (such as security standards and regulatory requirements), enhances automation, consistency, and auditability in cloud-native environments, and is suitable for large-scale cloud deployments and DevOps practices.\n\nThe integration core includes: IaC tools (such as Terraform or CloudFormation) to define infrastructure, configuration management tools to specify application-layer rules, and enforcement of compliance principles through Policy as Code (such as Open Policy Agent). When combined, automated testing and scanning are performed in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that configuration changes comply with standards. This reduces manual errors, improves security, and promotes efficient compliance coverage in scenarios such as Kubernetes clusters.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define compliance policies and infrastructure with code; 2. Integrate tools (such as linking Terraform with Ansible); 3. Add automated testing phases (Linting, scanning); 4. Continuous monitoring and auditing. A typical example is ensuring GDPR compliance during cloud migration, which brings business value: accelerating deployment, reducing risk costs, and enhancing compliance resilience."
