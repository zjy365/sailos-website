In a cloud-native development environment, secrets management refers to the process of securely storing, controlling access to, and managing the lifecycle of sensitive information such as API keys and certificates. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and unauthorized access, with application scenarios including microservice authentication, database connections, and configuration injection.

The core components involve encrypted storage, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and auditing mechanisms. In practical applications, Kubernetes Secrets provide native secret handling, while tools like HashiCorp Vault support dynamic secrets and automatic rotation. This enhances system security, enables scalable distribution of secrets, and facilitates compliance auditing, with impacts including reduced configuration errors and increased resilience of microservice architectures.

Implementation steps: First, use Kubernetes Secrets to store secrets; second, integrate cloud services such as AWS Secrets Manager for encryption management; and finally, automate rotation and monitoring. Typical scenarios are applicable to securely configuring containerized applications, with business values including reducing security risks, meeting regulations such as GDPR, and improving development efficiency.
