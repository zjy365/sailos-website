Cost management in multi-cloud environments refers to monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing expenditures across multiple cloud platforms to ensure efficient resource utilization and budget control. Its importance lies in avoiding overspending, improving return on investment, and is applicable for enterprises scaling hybrid cloud deployments and meeting regulatory requirements.

Core components include cost tracking tools (such as AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management), resource tagging systems, prediction algorithms, and automated alerts. In practical applications, it involves collecting billing data through integrated APIs, analyzing usage trends to adjust instance sizes, influencing financial planning and cross-cloud resource coordination, thereby reducing waste and enhancing visibility.

Implementation steps include deploying a unified monitoring platform (such as CloudHealth or Kubecost), setting up tagging policies to track cost ownership, applying AI prediction models (such as historical data analysis) to optimize resource allocation, and conducting regular audits. Business value includes significant cost reduction (typically over 25%), enhanced operational agility, risk mitigation, and support for sustainable growth.
