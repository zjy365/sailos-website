Hybrid cloud storage integrates private and public cloud resources to handle large-scale data such as analytics or AI datasets, providing elastic scalability, cost optimization, and compliance governance. Its importance lies in supporting real-time data processing and multi-site redundancy, with applications in enterprise backup, media archiving, and multi-cloud workload deployment.

Core components include tiered storage (hot/cold data strategies), API gateway integration, and a unified management interface, with principles involving data synchronization and disaster recovery mechanisms. Practical applications enable cross-cloud data migration and secure access control, significantly improving resource utilization efficiency, and impacting the IT field by reducing latency and enhancing regulatory compatibility.

Implementation steps: Analyze data volume and requirements; select hybrid platforms such as AWS Outposts; deploy storage gateways; configure data tiering and encryption; automate monitoring. Typical scenarios include large-scale analytics pipelines, with business value of reducing TCO by over 30%, accelerating time-to-market, and ensuring business continuity.
