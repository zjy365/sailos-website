Best practices for managing multi-cloud applications involve strategies for efficiently deploying, operating, and governing applications across multiple public cloud environments. Their core value lies in avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing elasticity and resilience, optimizing cost-effectiveness (by leveraging the best features and services of different clouds), and meeting compliance and data residency requirements.

Key practices include: adopting unified orchestration tools (such as Terraform, Crossplane) to implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure environmental consistency; utilizing containerization (Docker) and container orchestration (Kubernetes, especially distributed K8s like Karmada or OCI specifications) to provide portability; implementing service meshes (such as Istio) to manage cross-cloud service communication and security; establishing a centralized monitoring, logging, and alerting system (such as the Prometheus+Grafana stack); integrating automated CI/CD pipelines to achieve consistent deployment; and enforcing unified security and compliance standards through policy engines (such as OPA).

Implementation steps: First, design a cloud-native and multi-cloud-enabled application architecture. Second, select and deploy a multi-cluster management platform to achieve a unified perspective. Third, use IaC tools to automate cloud resource configuration and lifecycle management. Integrate monitoring and CI/CD to achieve automated deployment and operational visualization. Finally, continuously optimize costs (FinOps) and audit cross-cloud policy enforcement. This leads to improved business agility, reduced risks, and cost optimization.
