Managing containerized service configurations in an IaC workflow involves using code to automate the definition and deployment of infrastructure resources, such as container orchestration tools (Kubernetes). This enhances deployment consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency, suitable for cloud-native application development scenarios, ensuring the reliability of microservices and DevOps practices.

The core components include configuration definition files (e.g., Helm charts or Terraform modules), version control systems (e.g., Git), and IaC tools (e.g., Ansible or Pulumi). Through modular design and automated testing, it supports rapid iteration, reduces configuration drift, and enables scalable service management across multiple environments (e.g., hybrid clouds).

Implementation steps: Define container configuration code; integrate into version control repositories; automate testing, deployment, and rollback through CI/CD pipelines. Business values include accelerating release cycles, reducing the risk of human errors, and enhancing infrastructure compliance and cost optimization.
