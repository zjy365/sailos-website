Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system. Containers are lightweight, isolated units for running applications. In cloud-native deployments, they enable automated management, scalability, and security of applications, which are crucial for building resilient microservices architectures, such as supporting highly available APIs in hybrid cloud or multi-cloud environments.

The core components of protection include RBAC for managing access permissions, Secrets for encrypting and storing sensitive data, Network Policies for isolating Pod communications, and Security Contexts for enforcing resource restrictions. These features reduce the attack surface, prevent data leaks and configuration vulnerabilities, and enhance compliance and operational resilience for applications, such as preventing unauthorized access in financial services.

Implementation steps: 1. Define RBAC roles and bindings. 2. Use Kubernetes Secrets to securely store credentials. 3. Configure Network Policies to control traffic. 4. Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities. 5. Set Pod SecurityContext to restrict permissions. Typical scenarios include web application protection; business values include improving security resilience, reducing costs, and supporting audit compliance.
