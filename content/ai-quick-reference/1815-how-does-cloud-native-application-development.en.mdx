Cloud-native application development leverages cloud resources by designing applications as scalable, elastic containerized services, with the core being the abstraction of underlying infrastructure management. Its importance lies in improving resource utilization, reducing costs, and enhancing agility, making it suitable for dynamic load scenarios such as e-commerce transaction peaks or microservice architecture deployments.

The core components include containers (e.g., Docker for isolation), Kubernetes orchestration (automated deployment and scaling), microservices (modular design), and CI/CD pipelines. Features include auto-scaling, self-healing, and multi-cloud compatibility. Practical applications are reflected in dynamically allocating resources during high concurrency, reducing latency, and improving application reliability, with impacts covering operational efficiency optimization and accelerated innovation.

Implementation steps are: 1) Containerizing application code; 2) Deploying on a Kubernetes cluster, setting resource quotas and scaling policies; 3) Integrating cloud monitoring tools to automate responses to traffic changes. A typical scenario is elastic scaling during emergencies, with business values including significant infrastructure cost savings, improved user response speed, and support for rapid iteration in continuous deployment.
