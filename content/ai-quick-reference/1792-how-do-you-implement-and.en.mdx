Automated deployment of cloud-native machine learning models utilizes technologies such as containerization, microservices, and CI/CD to ensure rapid and reliable iteration of models from development to production. Its core value lies in resolving environment differences, accelerating上线 (launch), improving resource utilization and model observability, and is suitable for scenarios such as high-concurrency inference, AB testing, and continuous training.

The core architecture includes the following components: 1) A version control repository (e.g., Git) for model code and Dockerfiles; 2) CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Tekton, Argo CD) to automatically build model images and push them to image repositories (e.g., Harbor); 3) Kubernetes to manage model service replicas and rolling updates through declarative deployment (e.g., Kustomize); 4) Service mesh (e.g., Istio) to handle traffic routing and canary releases; 5) Monitoring and logging systems (e.g., Prometheus+Grafana+ELK) to track performance metrics and prediction drift.

The implementation steps are: first, containerize the model inference code and write deployment manifests; second, configure CI/CD pipelines to trigger image building and pushing; then, deploy to the K8s cluster and configure HPA for automatic scaling; finally, integrate monitoring and alerting. This process enables minute-level model release, reduces operational risks, and lowers costs through dynamic resource optimization. Typical business values include improving experimental iteration efficiency by over 60% and saving inference resource costs by 30%.
