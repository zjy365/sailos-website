  "content": "A hotfix is an emergency patch for critical vulnerabilities in the production environment. Deployment using CI/CD ensures secure and rapid release, which is crucial for maintaining system stability and business continuity. Typical scenarios include fixing security vulnerabilities and severe functional defects.\n\nThe core of deploying a hotfix via CI/CD is creating a dedicated hotfix branch (e.g., hotfix/xxx), which contains only the necessary fix code. After committing modifications, the CI/CD pipeline is automatically triggered to execute builds, unit tests, and integration tests to verify the effectiveness of the fix. Deployment is exclusively for this branch and strictly limited to the affected production environment, isolated from trunk development; upon success, the hotfix branch must be merged back into the trunk branch to maintain code consistency.\n\nThe specific steps are as follows: 1. Create a hotfix branch from the production-corresponding Tag; 2. Commit the fix code in the branch; 3. Trigger CI (build and run automated tests); 4. Deploy to production after CD phase verification; 5. Immediately monitor the production environment to verify the effect; 6. After confirming the hotfix is effective, merge it back to the main branch and update the Tag. This process ensures the speed, security, and traceability of emergency fixes, minimizing downtime risks to the greatest extent."
