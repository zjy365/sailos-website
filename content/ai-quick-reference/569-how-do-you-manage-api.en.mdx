The API Gateway is a core entry point in microservices architecture, which uniformly manages request routing, security authentication, and traffic control between clients and various microservices. Its importance lies in enhancing overall system security, reducing latency, and simplifying client interactions. It is mainly used in multi-service environments to ensure API manageability, implement rate limiting and load balancing, such as exposing backend services in e-commerce or financial platforms.

The core components include routing rules (mapping requests to target microservices), security policies (such as JWT authentication and IP whitelisting), monitoring logs, and aggregation mechanisms. Features include high availability and scalability, and the principle is to intercept requests for filtering and forwarding. Practical applications include configuring routes based on Envoy or Kong, or combining Kubernetes Ingress to implement unified policy management on cloud-native platforms, which significantly affects system maintainability and performance optimization.

Implementation steps include: 1. Selecting tools (such as AWS API Gateway or Nginx); 2. Defining API routes and microservice mappings; 3. Configuring security policies (authentication and rate limiting); 4. Deploying the gateway and integrating monitoring systems. Typical scenarios involve handling high-concurrency API exposure, bringing business values including reducing operational costs, enhancing observability, and accelerating service iteration.
