  "content": "Microservices architecture decomposes an application into small, independently deployable services, each focusing on a single business function. This architecture supports agile development teams in rapid iteration and responding to changing requirements, and is commonly used in high-concurrency systems such as e-commerce platforms to improve development efficiency and flexibility.\n\nIts core characteristics are service autonomy, loose coupling, and independent deployment, enabling teams to develop their respective services in parallel without overall coordination. This accelerates release cycles, reduces dependency bottlenecks, significantly enhances the synergy and fault tolerance of agile practices, and is widely applied in CI/CD environments.\n\nImplementation steps include modularizing and splitting functions, assigning dedicated small teams to maintain services, and integrating automated deployment tools. Typical scenarios include accelerating the launch of new features, and the business value lies in shortening time-to-market, enhancing scalability, and reducing maintenance costs."
