Monitoring CI/CD pipeline performance involves evaluating efficiency metrics of automated build, test, and deployment processes. This is crucial for ensuring software delivery reliability, accelerating iterations, and optimizing resource utilization, especially widely applied in cloud-native and Kubernetes environments to enhance the productivity of development teams.

Key metrics include deployment frequency (measuring release speed), change failure rate (assessing stability), mean time to recovery (MTTR, reflecting fault handling capability), and build time (evaluating processing latency). These metrics quantify pipeline efficiency, help identify bottlenecks such as test failures or resource limitations, and guide process optimization to reduce risks and improve overall release quality.

The application of these metrics promotes rapid feedback loops, strengthens development stability, and reduces downtime risks. Their value lies in shortening time-to-market, enhancing software reliability, and improving team collaboration efficiency, thereby increasing business competitiveness and customer satisfaction.
