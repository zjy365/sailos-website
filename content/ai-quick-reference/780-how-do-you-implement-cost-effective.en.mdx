Cloud-native storage leverages the scalability and automation mechanisms of cloud services to handle large-scale data, emphasizing cost-effectiveness to optimize expenses. It is crucial in scenarios such as artificial intelligence training and big data analytics, effectively addressing the pressure of data growth and reducing operational overhead.

Core components include object storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) and distributed file systems, with dynamic provisioning enabled through the Kubernetes Storage Interface (CSI). Features involve on-demand pricing, automatic scaling, and data redundancy, enhancing reliability and reducing storage costs by approximately 30-50%. Practical applications include real-time stream processing and content delivery, driving scalable data processing.

Implementation steps: 1. Select cost-effective object storage services. 2. Integrate Kubernetes storage policies and set data lifecycle rules. 3. Apply compression and deduplication technologies to optimize space. Typical scenarios include online analytics; business value is reflected in reducing storage costs by over 30% and supporting elastic scaling for high-traffic applications.
