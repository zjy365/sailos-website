  "content": "Serverless architecture is a cloud computing model where developers do not need to manage server infrastructure, and functions automatically scale in response to event triggers. In data management, its importance lies in handling the statelessness of functions to avoid state loss, with application scenarios including real-time event-driven systems, API backends, and data analytics. Data must be persisted through external services to ensure consistency and reliability.\n\nThe core components involve using managed data services such as AWS DynamoDB or Azure Cosmos DB for storage, featuring high availability, automatic scaling, and encryption. The principle is to isolate computing and data through API calls, with functions only handling transient logic. In practical applications, event-driven designs (e.g., message queues) implement asynchronous writes to avoid database bottlenecks. The impacts include simplified operations and maintenance, support for large-scale concurrency, but attention must be paid to cold start delays and data governance challenges.\n\nImplementation steps include: selecting compatible data storage services (such as NoSQL or SQL databases), integrating a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to accelerate access, and designing an API gateway to manage input/output. Typical scenarios are user session processing or log aggregation. The business value lies in reducing infrastructure costs, improving elasticity, and supporting rapid iteration in agile development."
