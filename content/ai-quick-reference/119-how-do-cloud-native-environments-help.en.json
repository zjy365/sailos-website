  "content": "Cloud-native environments are based on containerization and orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, providing elastic resource management and isolation mechanisms that significantly enhance container security. Their importance lies in addressing modern threats like misconfigurations and vulnerability attacks, with application scenarios covering cloud deployment, microservice architectures, and edge computing environments.\n\nCore components include Pod Security Policies, service mesh network isolation, and image scanning tools such as Trivy, characterized by fine-grained access control and runtime protection. These principles support automated security compliance, promote DevSecOps integration, and have impacts including reducing vulnerability exploitation and data breach risks, as well as enhancing application resilience.\n\nDuring implementation, configure RBAC and network policies to restrict access, and integrate continuous scanning processes to monitor image vulnerabilities. Typical scenarios involve automated detection in CI/CD pipelines and key management, with business values of reducing operational costs, improving compliance, and accelerating security responses."
