Vulnerability scanning is the process of conducting security checks on cloud-native container images to identify issues such as CVE vulnerabilities. Its importance lies in ensuring the security of images deployed in environments like Kubernetes, preventing security incidents, and supporting compliance requirements. Application scenarios include checks during the build phase of CI/CD pipelines or before deployment to enhance overall system security.

Core components include static analysis tools (such as Trivy or Clair), which scan libraries to compare image dependencies. Features involve automation, real-time database updates, and vulnerability prioritization. In practical applications, integration into CI/CD enables automatic issue detection and risk reduction; it has a significant impact on DevSecOps by improving image reliability and lowering downtime costs caused by security vulnerabilities.

Implementation steps: 1. Select a tool (e.g., Trivy); 2. Scan immediately after image building; 3. Analyze reports and fix vulnerabilities; 4. Automate integration into CI/CD pipelines. Typical scenarios include testing environments or pre-production deployments. Business values include enhancing security posture, reducing the risk of compliance fines, and accelerating the secure development lifecycle.
