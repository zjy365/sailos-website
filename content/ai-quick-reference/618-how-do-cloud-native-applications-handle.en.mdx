Cloud-native applications manage data persistence (data remains accessible outside the container lifecycle) and reliability (high data availability and integrity) through specific mechanisms in containerized environments. This is crucial because cloud applications often involve dynamic scaling and microservice architectures, with application scenarios including distributed databases, stateful services, and real-time analytics systems to ensure business continuity.

Core components include Kubernetes' StatefulSets for ordered management of stateful Pods, Persistent Volumes (PV) providing external storage binding, Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) defining storage requirements, and StorageClasses enabling dynamic provisioning. Features such as CSI plugins integrate with cloud storage services (e.g., AWS EBS) to implement automated volume provisioning and snapshot backups. In practical applications, these mechanisms enhance data fault tolerance and disaster recovery capabilities, support high-availability architectures, and have a positive impact on SLAs and compliance.

Implementation steps are: deploy StatefulSets to define Pod sequences; create PVCs to match StorageClasses; integrate backup tools like Velero for regular snapshots. A typical scenario is financial transaction systems, ensuring zero data loss. Business value includes reducing downtime, enhancing data consistency, and supporting elastic scaling, directly improving system reliability and user experience.
