  "content": "Multi-cloud deployment refers to applications running across multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), and monitoring strategies are crucial for ensuring availability, performance consistency, and rapid fault response. It is applicable to scenarios where enterprises aim to avoid vendor lock-in, enhance resilience, and meet compliance requirements.\n\nThe core components include unified data collection agents (e.g., Prometheus), standardized metrics (CPU, network latency), automated alert systems, and visualization dashboards (e.g., Grafana). Its features are cross-cloud integration and real-time insights, and practical applications can improve operational efficiency, simplify security audits, and promote agile development practices.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Define unified monitoring metrics and SLOs, 2) Select integration tools or cloud-native solutions like OpenTelemetry, 3) Deploy agents to collect cross-cloud data, 4) Configure alerts and dashboards. Typical scenarios include load balancing monitoring, and the business value lies in optimizing resource costs and reducing downtime."
