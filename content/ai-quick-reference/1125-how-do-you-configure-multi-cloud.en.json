  "content": "Cloud orchestration refers to the process of automating the deployment and management of cloud-native applications across multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). It avoids vendor lock-in, enhances business elasticity and reliability, and is suitable for hybrid cloud deployment, disaster recovery, and global load balancing scenarios.\n\nCore components include unified control plane tools (such as Kubernetes Federation or Karmada), service mesh management (such as Istio Service Mesh), and cross-cloud APIs. The principle involves synchronizing application states through declarative configurations to achieve auto-scaling, failover, and policy consistency. It is practically applied in multi-region deployments, ensuring data compliance, and optimizing resource costs.\n\nConfiguration steps: 1) Select a coordination platform (e.g., Anthos or Rancher); 2) Establish cross-cloud networks and security policies (such as VPC peering); 3) Implement lifecycle management through monitoring after application deployment. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud failover, with business values including cost reduction by over 20% and enhanced SLA to 99.99%."
