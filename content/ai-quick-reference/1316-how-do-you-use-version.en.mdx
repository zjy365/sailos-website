Version control (e.g., Git) is used to centrally manage code and configuration changes, ensuring that all environment changes are traceable. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates the build, testing, and release processes. The combination of the two is crucial for maintaining consistency across development, testing, production, and other environments, avoiding failures caused by environmental differences, and improving deployment reliability.

Core practices include: 1) Environment configuration as code: Define environments using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible), and include configuration files in Git management to ensure reproducibility of environment creation and changes. 2) CI pipeline standardization: After the pipeline is triggered, automatically build application container images and generate unique version tags. 3) CD controlled release: Use the same container image and configuration version, and deploy to various environments in stages through different CD processes (e.g., automatic deployment to test environment, approval required for production environment). Environment variables are injected through controlled methods instead of hard coding.

Practical operation steps: 1. Submit code changes to the Git repository; 2. In the CI phase, run tests, build container images, and push them to the image repository; 3. In the CD phase, call IaC tools to deploy the target environment using specific versions of images and configurations. The ultimate business values include: eliminating configuration drift and improving environment reconstruction efficiency; ensuring the consistency of binaries and configurations used in each deployment; and implementing a reliable rollback mechanism.
