Ansible Playbooks are tools that use YAML files to define automation tasks, enabling Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which manages resources through code rather than manual configuration. This automation enhances environmental consistency, repeatability, and efficiency, with wide applications in cloud deployment, container management, or network setup, supporting continuous integration scenarios.

The core components include task lists (each task invokes modules such as `cloudformation`), variables, and templates, ensuring safe modifications through idempotent operations. Features include a declarative language and an SSH-based agentless architecture. In practical applications, Playbooks can automatically configure virtual machines, deploy load balancers, or update cloud storage, reducing errors and accelerating the DevOps lifecycle.

Implementation steps involve: installing Ansible, writing a Playbook to define resource states (such as creating an instance using an AWS module), specifying target hosts in an inventory file, and running the `ansible-playbook` command to execute. Typical scenarios include rapid cloud infrastructure deployment; business values include shortening delivery time, reducing costs, and enhancing reliability and team collaboration efficiency.
