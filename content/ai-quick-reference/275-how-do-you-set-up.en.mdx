Serverless applications utilize event-driven computing models such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, eliminating the need to manage server infrastructure. Setting up a deployment pipeline is crucial as it automates building, testing, and deployment, enhancing development efficiency, reliability, and iteration speed, suitable for rapid release scenarios of cloud-native applications.

Core components include code repositories (e.g., Git), CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins), and serverless frameworks (e.g., Serverless Framework). Features encompass continuous integration, automated testing, and rollback mechanisms; the principle is to trigger pipeline execution through events. In practical applications, it accelerates release cycles, improves scalability and fault tolerance, exerts a significant impact on DevOps culture, and simplifies microservice deployment.

Setup steps: 1. Configure a source control repository and push code. 2. Select a CI/CD tool to create a pipeline, defining build and test stages. 3. Integrate testing tools to execute unit and integration tests. 4. Deploy to a serverless platform (e.g., using SAM templates). A typical scenario is event-driven microservices; business values include reducing operational burden, increasing release frequency, optimizing resource costs, and accelerating time-to-market.
