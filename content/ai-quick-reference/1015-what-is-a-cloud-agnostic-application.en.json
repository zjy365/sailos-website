  "content": "Cloud-agnostic applications refer to software designs that do not rely on specific cloud providers and can run on any cloud platform. Their importance lies in avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing deployment flexibility and cost control. Application scenarios include multi-cloud strategies and hybrid cloud environments to strengthen business resilience and continuity.\n\nCore components include containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), and cloud-neutral APIs. They are characterized by abstracting infrastructure dependencies through microservice architecture, with the principle of implementing standardized interfaces. In multi-cloud environments, they are automatically deployed to platforms such as AWS and Azure, supporting load balancing, disaster recovery, and resource optimization to improve reliability and efficiency.\n\nIn practical work, applications are packaged as container images and automatically scheduled and scaled in multi-cloud clusters through Kubernetes. Implementation steps include using CI/CD for automated migration and monitoring, bringing business values such as high availability, cost savings, and risk reduction, and promoting innovation and agile response."
