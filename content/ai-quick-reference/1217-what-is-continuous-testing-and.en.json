  "content": "Continuous testing is a practice in software development that continuously executes automated tests to ensure rapid quality verification after each code change. Its importance lies in identifying defects early, reducing regression risks, and accelerating delivery, primarily applied in CI/CD pipelines within agile development and DevOps environments.\n\nCore components include automated unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, characterized by high-frequency execution and immediate feedback. In CI/CD, the testing phase is automatically triggered after building, providing real-time results to assess code quality. The practical impact is supporting continuous delivery, reducing production defect rates, and improving team efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps for integrating into CI/CD: 1) Write automated test scripts; 2) Integrate into CI tools (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions); 3) Configure to trigger tests on each code commit; 4) Decide on deployment based on test results. A typical scenario is the DevOps pipeline, with business values including shortening release cycles and enhancing software reliability."
