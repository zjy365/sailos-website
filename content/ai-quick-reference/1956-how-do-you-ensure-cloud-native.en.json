  "content": "In cloud-native environments, access control is crucial for ensuring application security by strictly managing access permissions for users, services, and resources to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. It is the core of the zero-trust architecture and applies to scenarios such as microservice API security, multi-tenant isolation, and Kubernetes cluster operation and maintenance management.\n\nThe core components include authentication (identity verification), authorization (permission determination), and auditing (logging). Key features are based on the principle of least privilege and fine-grained authorization. In Kubernetes, roles and bindings are defined through RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to control operations on objects such as Pods and Services. Service meshes (e.g., Istio) provide fine-grained authorization policies for inter-service communication. Centralized identity providers (e.g., OIDC) manage identities uniformly.\n\nDeploy an API gateway to implement entry authentication and authorization; configure RBAC role bindings with least privilege in the Kubernetes cluster; use NetworkPolicy to control network traffic between Pods; define service-level authorization policies for the service mesh; enforce mTLS for inter-service identity authentication; integrate audit logs to continuously monitor access activities. Implementation significantly reduces the attack surface, meets compliance requirements, and protects sensitive data."
