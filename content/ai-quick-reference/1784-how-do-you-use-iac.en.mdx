IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates infrastructure configuration management through code, enhancing consistency, traceability, and efficiency. Its importance lies in reducing human errors and ensuring security compliance; application scenarios include cloud environment deployment, DevOps pipelines, and regulatory audits, avoiding vulnerabilities of manual configuration.

Core components include code definition files (such as Terraform or CloudFormation templates), version control systems (e.g., Git), and automated toolchains. Features are testability, reusability, and dynamic update principles. In practical applications, IaC embeds security policies (like network ACLs or encryption rules), enforces compliance baselines, and reduces the risk of data breaches.

Implementation steps: 1. Define compliance requirements, such as NIST or HIPAA benchmarks. 2. Encode security policies into IaC templates. 3. Integrate CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment. 4. Automate monitoring and report anomalies. A typical scenario is AWS VPC configuration protection; business value is accelerating compliance audits, saving costs, and strengthening overall security posture.
