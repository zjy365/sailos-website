Cloud-native applications achieve high reliability and uptime through containerization, microservices, and declarative APIs, which are crucial in cloud computing environments. They ensure the continuous operation of critical businesses (such as e-commerce platforms or real-time services), reduce downtime losses, and support high availability and elastic scaling.

Core components include redundancy design (e.g., Kubernetes Pod replicas), automatic health checks, failover mechanisms, and continuous deployment strategies. Through automated monitoring, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities, they ensure zero-downtime upgrades and rapid failure recovery, enhancing the stability of distributed systems and are widely used in large-scale internet services and enterprise applications.

Implementation steps: Deploy multi-replica Pods; configure liveness and readiness probes to monitor service status; enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and rolling update strategies; continuously collect logs and metrics to optimize performance. The business value lies in reducing maintenance costs, improving user experience, and achieving over 99.9% availability.
