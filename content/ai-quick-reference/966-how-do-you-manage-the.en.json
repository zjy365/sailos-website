  "content": "Cloud-native storage service security refers to protecting container storage data from unauthorized access and leakage, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Its importance lies in meeting compliance requirements (such as GDPR), preventing data risks, and being applied to Kubernetes cluster storage (such as PV/PVC) and hybrid cloud environments.\n\nThe core includes access control (such as RBAC fine-grained authorization), data encryption (transport and storage layers), audit logs, and compliance checks. Based on the zero-trust principle, dynamic configuration is achieved through storage policies (such as CSI plugins), with practical impacts of reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing multi-tenant isolation.\n\nManagement steps: 1. Configure RBAC and network policies to restrict access; 2. Enable encryption (such as KMS integration); 3. Deploy audit tools to monitor operations; 4. Regularly scan for compliance. Business values include reducing security risks, ensuring business continuity, and optimizing trust and cost efficiency."
