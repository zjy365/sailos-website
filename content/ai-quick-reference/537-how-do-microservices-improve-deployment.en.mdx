Microservices architecture splits monolithic applications into independently deployable, loosely coupled small services. This modular design significantly improves the efficiency of deployment automation, as each service can be independently developed, tested, and launched, avoiding the bottleneck of large deployment packages in monolithic applications, and is particularly suitable for complex systems requiring rapid iteration.

Its core lies in service autonomy: each microservice has its own code repository and CI/CD pipeline. Teams can update services independently by simply triggering the corresponding pipeline, which automatically completes building, container image packaging, and K8s cluster deployment (such as rolling updates or blue-green deployment). Containerization (e.g., Docker) provides environmental consistency, while K8s enables orchestration, scaling, and self-healing, greatly simplifying the automation process.

Specific implementation steps: Establish independent build pipelines for each microservice; automate container image building and repository pushing; use K8s manifests (or Helm Charts) to define deployment rules; integrate monitoring to trigger automated rollbacks. This model granularizes deployment units, supports minute-level feature launches, reduces risks, accelerates feedback loops, enhances overall system stability through small-scale releases, and empowers DevOps for high-frequency deliveries.
