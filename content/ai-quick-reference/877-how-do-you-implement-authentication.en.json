  "content": "In cloud-native web applications, authentication is the process of verifying user identities to ensure that only authorized users access resources. It is crucial because it protects sensitive data from attacks such as unauthorized API calls, and is widely used in distributed microservice architectures, such as e-commerce platforms or financial systems.\n\nThe core of authentication includes token-based schemes (e.g., JWT or OAuth), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and security protocols (e.g., OpenID Connect). It is characterized by scalability, low latency, and dynamic configuration, and integrates with cloud-native tools like Kubernetes Ingress or API gateways to implement single sign-on. In practical applications, it enhances the security of microservice communication through service meshes (e.g., Istio), improves compliance, and reduces data breach risks.\n\nThe implementation steps are as follows: 1. Select an identity provider (e.g., Keycloak); 2. Integrate into the frontend (using OAuth) and backend services; 3. Set up RBAC policies via Kubernetes; 4. Monitor audit logs. A typical scenario is protecting microservice APIs, with business values including reduced operational risks and increased user trust."
