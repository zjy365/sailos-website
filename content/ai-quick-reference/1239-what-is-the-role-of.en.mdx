GitOps is an automated deployment model that uses a Git repository as the single source of truth, managing applications and infrastructure through declarative configurations. In CI/CD pipelines, it ensures consistent, auditable, and efficient deployment processes, reduces human errors, and is suitable for cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes orchestration, enhancing continuity from development to production.

Its core includes Git-based configuration storage, automated triggers (such as pull requests), and self-healing mechanisms for continuous reconciliation of the actual state. Features include observability and continuous deployment capabilities. In practical applications, GitOps integrates CI tools to execute tests and automatically deploy updates, with impacts including accelerated release cycles, enhanced team collaboration, and system reliability.

In CI/CD pipelines, GitOps is responsible for the automated deployment phase, ensuring that new versions are applied on demand and synchronized in real time. Application values include providing zero-touch deployment, enhancing security compliance, and simplifying rollback processes, thereby significantly improving business agility and cost efficiency.
