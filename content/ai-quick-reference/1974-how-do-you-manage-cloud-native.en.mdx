Cloud-native application configuration management refers to the process of coordinating application parameters and settings. Its importance lies in ensuring cross-environment consistency, reducing deployment errors, and supporting agile iterations. Application scenarios include multi-team collaboration in large organizations, such as the development and operation of microservices architectures.

Core components include configuration as code (e.g., YAML), GitOps workflows, and tools like Argo CD or Flux. The principle is based on version control and declarative management, implemented in Kubernetes using ConfigMaps and Secrets for separation. In practical applications, it promotes environment isolation (development, testing, production), enhances security and observability, and significantly reduces the risk of configuration drift.

Implementation steps: Define unified configuration standards; set up a central Git repository to store configurations; integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated auditing; apply RBAC permission control. In typical scenarios, teams review changes through pull requests. Business values include accelerating release cycles, reducing the cost of operational errors, and enhancing cross-team collaboration efficiency.
