  "content": "The microservices architecture decomposes an application into independent, independently deployable small services, each running in an isolated environment. The importance of this architecture lies in supporting high concurrency and scalability, improving system performance and reliability, and is widely used in scenarios such as e-commerce or social media to handle multi-user requests.\n\nCore features include containerized deployment and API communication, with load balancers distributing requests to multiple microservice instances. Using the Kubernetes orchestration platform, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of instances. This mechanism enhances fault isolation and response efficiency, reduces latency in high-traffic environments, and impacts the system resilience of the entire cloud-native ecosystem.\n\nImplementation steps: Design lightweight microservices, deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster with multiple replicas configured. Set up load balancing policies and enable auto-scaling to add instances for handling peak traffic. A typical scenario is peak user login times, with business values including reduced costs, improved resource utilization, and enhanced user satisfaction."
