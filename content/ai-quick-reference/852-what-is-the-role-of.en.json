  "content": "Container runtime security refers to mechanisms that protect containers from malicious activities during their execution phase, and it is a core element of cloud-native application security. Its importance lies in ensuring application reliability, data integrity, and runtime isolation. Application scenarios include dynamic environments such as Kubernetes clusters, used to prevent container escape attacks, configuration errors, and unauthorized access.\n\nThe core components include isolation mechanisms (such as namespaces and cgroups), real-time monitoring tools (e.g., Falco or Open Policy Agent), and behavioral analysis features. The principles are based on the principle of least privilege, continuous scanning, and policy enforcement, such as restricting container privileges through security contexts. In practical applications, it is integrated into container runtimes (such as containerd) to implement automated threat detection, which has a significant impact on Kubernetes management, preventing supply chain vulnerabilities and enhancing system resilience.\n\nIts role is reflected in ensuring the operational security of cloud-native applications, reducing the risk of data leakage through active protection mechanisms, meeting compliance requirements (such as GDPR), and improving business continuity. The value includes reducing accident costs, optimizing security operation efficiency, thereby accelerating application delivery and strengthening trust."
