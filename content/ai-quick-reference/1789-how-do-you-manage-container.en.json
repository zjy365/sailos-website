  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates infrastructure configuration through code, serving as a core mechanism for container security management to ensure consistency and compliance. Its importance lies in eliminating manual errors, applied in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to define security policies such as image scanning and policy enforcement.\n\nCore components include IaC tools (e.g., Terraform or Kubernetes YAML), policy as code, and integrated security scanning (e.g., Trivy for scanning container images). The principle is based on version control and automated execution to ensure security baselines. In practical applications, it influences network security rule settings, monitors vulnerabilities in real-time, and enhances overall deployment security.\n\nImplementation steps: First, define security requirements in code (e.g., image vulnerability scanning); second, integrate tools into CI/CD pipelines for automated detection; finally, deploy monitoring for continuous verification. Business values include risk reduction, improved compliance efficiency, and support for rapid response to security incidents."
