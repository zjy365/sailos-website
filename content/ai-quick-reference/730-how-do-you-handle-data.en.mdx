Handling data storage for edge computing applications in a cloud-native environment involves storing data at edge locations close to the data source, combined with containerization technology to reduce latency. This is crucial as it supports real-time response scenarios such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), avoids network congestion, and ensures data timeliness.

Core components include lightweight container orchestration tools like K3s, distributed storage systems such as MinIO or EdgeFS, and data synchronization mechanisms like Kubernetes Operators. Features include data localization, elastic scaling, and consistency guarantees. In practical applications, such as sensor data processing in smart factories, it can reduce central cloud load, improve system reliability, and promote efficient resource utilization.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy K3s clusters on edge devices. 2. Configure local persistent volumes or lightweight databases. 3. Asynchronously synchronize critical data to cloud storage. A typical scenario is remote medical device monitoring, with business values including reducing latency to milliseconds, optimizing bandwidth costs, and enhancing real-time decision-making.
