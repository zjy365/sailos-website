Infrastructure as Code (IaC) refers to the process of managing and configuring computing resources through declarative code. Its core value lies in ensuring the consistency and repeatability of resource configurations, which is crucial for enforcing organizational policies. Application scenarios include large-scale deployments, security compliance, and change management.

The core of achieving policy compliance is to encode organizational policies and integrate them into the IaC lifecycle. Key steps include: 1. Directly defining policy rules (such as network isolation and encryption standards) in IaC templates (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation); 2. Using policy-as-code tools like OPA and Checkov to automatically scan IaC configurations in CI/CD pipelines to identify deviations; 3. Configuring automated validation processes that only allow deployment when resource declarations comply with policies, blocking non-compliant changes.

This method enables proactive governance and avoids the lag of post-audit. Typical implementation steps: define codified policy rules -> integrate scanning tools into version control or CI processes -> set up deployment gates. Its business value includes reducing configuration drift, automatically meeting compliance audit requirements, significantly lowering manual verification costs, and accelerating secure deployment speed.
