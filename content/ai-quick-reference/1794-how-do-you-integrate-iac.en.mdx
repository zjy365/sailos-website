Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure through code, monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) track performance and health status, and security tools (such as SonarQube or security scanners) detect vulnerabilities and threats. Integrating the three is crucial, as it enables monitoring and security policies to be automatically embedded during the IaC deployment phase, ensuring that infrastructure is observable and secure from the outset, suitable for CI/CD pipelines to implement risk detection and remediation before automated deployment.

The core principle is to directly declare monitoring and security configurations in IaC templates (such as Terraform, Ansible) and dynamically associate the toolchain during deployment through automated scripts. For example, using Terraform to configure CloudWatch Agent or inject security scanning tasks. After deployment, these tools provide real-time feedback on operational metrics, abnormal events, and security vulnerabilities, forming a closed-loop management system that extends from static configuration to a dynamically optimized continuous system, significantly improving the efficiency of identifying infrastructure compliance and resilience issues.

The implementation steps are divided into three phases: first, embed monitoring metric collectors (such as Prometheus exporters) and security policy rules (such as CIS benchmarks) in IaC templates; second, integrate automated testing in the CI/CD process (such as using OPA policy checks or Terratest); finally, conduct real-time analysis and feedback through log aggregators (such as ELK) and alerting tools (such as Grafana) to drive iterative updates of IaC. This practice significantly reduces production remediation costs, accelerates the achievement of security compliance, and supports high business availability.
