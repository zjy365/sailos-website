Automation deployment tools manage secrets through centralized secure storage and dynamic injection mechanisms, ensuring that sensitive information (such as API keys and passwords) is not hard-coded in code or configuration files. Their importance lies in ensuring application security, applicable to scenarios like CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native application deployment, avoiding the risk of secret leakage.

The core components include secret vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KSM), encrypted transmission, and least privilege access control. Features include decoupling secrets from the deployment process, supporting dynamic generation, automatic rotation, and audit logs. In practical applications, tools inject secrets into the runtime environment (such as environment variables or file mounts), significantly enhancing DevOps security and compliance while reducing human operation errors.

Implementation steps: 1. Use secret management services to centrally store secrets; 2. The deployment process dynamically retrieves secrets through secure APIs; 3. Inject into containers or applications at runtime. A typical scenario is Kubernetes deployment managing database credentials through Secrets objects. Business values include automated compliance auditing, reduced risk of security vulnerabilities, and improved deployment efficiency.
