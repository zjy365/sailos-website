  "content": "The IaC workflow (Infrastructure as Code) uses code to define and manage infrastructure, such as cloud resources or container platforms, and ensuring the automation of disaster recovery is crucial. Its importance lies in reducing human errors and downtime through predictable deployments, enhancing business continuity, applicable to recovery scenarios of Kubernetes clusters or cloud-native applications.\n\nThe core components include version control tools (e.g., Git) to maintain IaC scripts, CI/CD pipelines to implement automated building and testing, and infrastructure monitoring and rollback mechanisms. In practical applications, IaC standardizes disaster recovery processes, such as automatically rebuilding cluster nodes, thereby improving system consistency and recoverability, with impacts extending to reducing operational costs and meeting SLA compliance requirements.\n\nImplementation steps are: 1. Encode infrastructure definitions in IaC tools (e.g., Terraform or AWS CloudFormation). 2. Integrate automated scripts into CI/CD pipelines to execute recovery tasks. 3. Conduct regular disaster drills to validate processes. Typical business values include quickly restoring services (reducing from hours to minutes) to minimize revenue loss and enhance high availability."
