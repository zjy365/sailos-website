In a cloud-native environment, key management for microservices involves securely storing and distributing sensitive data such as API keys or database credentials, ensuring secure communication between microservices and preventing unauthorized access. Its importance lies in enhancing application security, meeting compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR), and it is widely used in containerized microservice architectures to safeguard service authentication and configuration privacy.

Core tools include Kubernetes Secrets and external solutions like HashiCorp Vault. Features encompass encrypted storage, access control (via RBAC), and dynamic rotation mechanisms. In principle, these tools automatically manage the key lifecycle, reduce human errors, improve the application efficiency of the zero-trust security model, significantly mitigate data breach risks, and enhance resilience.

Implementation steps: First, deploy a key store (such as Kubernetes Secrets or integrate Vault) and define Secret objects; second, configure role access permissions; third, automate key rotation and auditing; finally, inject keys into microservices instead of hardcoding them. Typical scenarios include dynamically pulling credentials when services start, with business values including optimized security, simplified operations and maintenance, and improved compliance.
