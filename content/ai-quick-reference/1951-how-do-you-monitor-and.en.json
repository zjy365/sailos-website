  "content": "Monitoring and protecting cloud-native applications in production environments is crucial for ensuring their reliability, performance, and security. The dynamic nature of cloud-native environments (such as microservices and container orchestration) requires the implementation of specialized visibility tracking, real-time threat detection, and dynamic policy enforcement to meet business continuity and compliance requirements.\n\nCore monitoring components include metrics collection (e.g., Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), log aggregation (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch), and distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger), which provide real-time insights into application status and performance bottlenecks. Security protection relies on service meshes (e.g., Istio's mTLS, authentication), runtime security (e.g., Falco), image scanning, and network security policies, forming a defense-in-depth system covering the supply chain, network transmission, and runtime layers.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1) Defining key SLO metrics and security policy baselines; 2) Deploying a unified monitoring stack and alert system; 3) Implementing a service mesh zero-trust architecture; 4) Integrating image scanning into CI/CD pipelines; 5) Configuring network policies and Pod security policies; 6) Establishing audit logs and automated response mechanisms. This enables rapid fault localization, prevents data breaches, and ensures the security of continuous delivery."
