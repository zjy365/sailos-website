  "content": "Migrating to a cloud-native development environment involves building applications using cloud services (such as containers and microservices) to enhance scalability, elasticity, and deployment efficiency. Its importance lies in supporting agile development and operational automation, making it suitable for business scenarios requiring rapid iteration, such as internet services and enterprise digital transformation.\n\nKey challenges include technical complexity (such as learning Kubernetes orchestration), architectural restructuring (breaking down monolithic applications into microservices), cultural transformation (DevOps collaboration), and security compliance risks (multi-tenant isolation, continuous monitoring). These factors increase migration difficulty and affect team collaboration and system stability.\n\nPractical challenges include skill gaps, legacy system compatibility, network governance, and cost optimization. By adopting phased migration (scaling after pilot projects), enhancing team training, and utilizing Service Mesh and automation tools (CI/CD), risks can be reduced, enabling the realization of values such as high availability, rapid delivery, and elastic resource scaling."
