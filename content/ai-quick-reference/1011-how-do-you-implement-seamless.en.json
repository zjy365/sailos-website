  "content": "Cross-cloud application migration refers to the process of transferring applications and data between different cloud service provider environments, which can avoid vendor lock-in and optimize costs and performance. Its key lies in minimizing downtime, ensuring consistency and security, and it is applicable to scenarios such as hybrid cloud deployment, disaster recovery and compliance requirements.\n\nThe core is to decouple applications from the underlying infrastructure: 1) Adopt containerization to package applications; 2) Use standard container orchestration layers such as Kubernetes for unified management; 3) Define environments through infrastructure as code tools (e.g., Terraform); 4) Standardize network policies and service discovery; 5) Implement continuous data synchronization solutions (e.g., Velero).\n\nImplementation process: 1) Evaluate target cloud compatibility and plan network architecture; 2) Containerize legacy applications; 3) Deploy standardized applications using Kubernetes manifests or Helm; 4) Configure multi-cloud data migration tools; 5) Perform phased verification and switching (blue-green deployment); 6) Continuously monitor and optimize. Business values include cost savings of 30%+, downtime reduced to seconds, and flexible supply chain management."
