Cloud-native data storage involves methods for managing persistent data in containerized and dynamic environments. Its importance lies in ensuring data consistency and reliability under the stateless architecture of applications, making it suitable for scenarios such as microservice communication and real-time analytics.

Core components include distributed storage systems (e.g., object storage, database services) with features like elastic scalability and fault tolerance. The principle relies on a storage abstraction layer (such as Kubernetes Persistent Volumes) to separate storage from computing. In practical applications, integration through service meshes enables data sharing and cross-region synchronization, significantly enhancing observability and migration efficiency.

Implementation steps include: first, evaluating storage types (block, file, or object storage); second, configuring PersistentVolumeClaims in Kubernetes to bind cloud provider services (e.g., AWS EBS); third, adopting the Operator pattern to automate backup and recovery. This approach supports business continuity, reduces operational costs, and empowers agile development and global deployment.
