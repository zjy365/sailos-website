  "content": "Cloud-native storage is a mechanism for managing persistent data in containerized environments, which is crucial for high-performance computing (HPC). Optimization can improve data throughput and reduce latency, and it is applied in high-IO scenarios such as scientific simulation, AI training, and big data analysis.\n\nThe core includes Container Storage Interface (CSI), Persistent Volume (PV/PVC), and StorageClass. The principle is based on distributed file systems (such as Lustre) or high-speed block storage to provide scalability and low latency. This significantly improves the efficiency of HPC tasks, reduces data transmission bottlenecks, and promotes the widespread adoption of cloud-native architecture.\n\nOptimization steps: Evaluate the IO requirements of H applications; select high-performance storage backends such as Alluxio or GPFS; configure Kubernetes StorageClass to define persistent volumes; optimize network paths using RDMA acceleration; implement performance monitoring tools. A typical scenario is gene sequence analysis. Business values include reducing computing costs, accelerating result delivery, and improving resource utilization."
