Microservices architecture splits monolithic applications into small, loosely coupled services. Its importance lies in supporting independent development, deployment, and scaling, significantly accelerating the iteration of complex systems. Typical application scenarios include large e-commerce platforms, financial systems, and other domains that need to quickly respond to business changes.

Core features include service autonomy (independent technology stacks, databases), clearly defined API boundaries, and decentralized governance. This allows multiple teams to develop and test services in parallel without mutual interference; updates to individual services do not require global deployment, enabling minute-level releases through CI/CD and greatly shortening the delivery cycle; the fault isolation feature also reduces testing and debugging costs.

During implementation: ① Divide service boundaries by business domain ② Establish independent deployment pipelines ③ Adopt containerization to encapsulate services. This architecture shortens the development cycle of new features from weeks to days, increases the response speed to business requirements by more than 60%, and creates significant competitive advantages especially in high-frequency iteration scenarios.
