CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, which ensures that code changes are delivered quickly and reliably by automating software building, testing, and deployment processes. Agile methodology emphasizes iterative development, rapid feedback, and team collaboration, and is suitable for scenarios where flexible responses to changing requirements are needed. Their integration is crucial as it can significantly accelerate the release cycle, reduce defects, and is widely used in modern cloud-native and containerized environments, such as the rapid delivery of microservices.

The core includes CI automatically triggering code building and testing, and CD promoting automated deployment to the production environment. Agile characteristics such as short iterations (Sprints) and continuous improvement, CI/CD automation supports daily builds, real-time feedback loops, and risk mitigation. In practical applications, this integration enhances the efficiency of agile teams, promotes small-batch deployments, reduces manual errors, and affects development processes such as shortening releases from weeks to hours, improving overall software quality.

Implementation steps: 1) Embed CI/CD toolchains (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI) in the agile framework; 2) Automate testing and deployment pipelines to align with Sprint goals; 3) Continuously monitor metrics to optimize processes. A typical scenario is the automatic release of incremental features at the end of a Sprint. Business values include accelerating time-to-market, reducing deployment risks, and improving customer satisfaction.
