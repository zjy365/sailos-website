  "content": "Security in microservices communication involves protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmission between services in distributed systems. This is crucial for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks, data leaks, and service tampering, especially applicable to highly regulated scenarios such as finance and healthcare.\n\nCore measures include mutual TLS (mTLS) to encrypt communication links, service meshes (e.g., Istio) for automated certificate management, API gateways for implementing fine-grained access control (based on JWT/OAuth2), and zero-trust architecture principles. These technologies can be integrated into platforms like Kubernetes, significantly enhancing system resilience and reducing the lateral attack surface.\n\nImplementation steps are as follows: First, deploy a service mesh (e.g., enabling Istio's automatic mTLS); second, configure authentication policies (e.g., JWT validation) through the API gateway; third, use a policy engine (e.g., OPA) to enforce service-level authorization; fourth, enable audit logs for real-time monitoring of anomalies. Typical benefits include compliance with GDPR, reduced operational costs, and support for rapid business iteration."
