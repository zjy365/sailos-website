  "content": "Legacy systems refer to software applications based on outdated technologies (such as monolithic architectures), and multi-cloud deployment is the utilization of resources from multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure). Integrating the two is crucial in a hybrid IT environment to enhance scalability, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure business continuity, applied in digital transformation scenarios such as finance or manufacturing.\n\nThe core principles involve API gateways, containerization (such as encapsulating applications with Docker), and middleware adapters to create an abstraction layer that isolates old and new systems. Features include using Kubernetes to orchestrate containers for deployment in multi-cloud environments, enabling seamless data exchange and elastic scaling. The practical impact is driving the modernization of legacy systems, supporting collaboration with cloud-native services (such as microservices), and enhancing enterprise agility and disaster recovery capabilities.\n\nImplementation steps: Assess legacy system compatibility; Containerize key modules; Select multi-cloud platforms and configure service meshes (such as Istio); Integrate API gateways to handle communications; Test and deploy monitoring. A typical scenario is migrating core functions to the cloud. Business values include optimizing resource usage, reducing vendor dependence, and accelerating innovation."
