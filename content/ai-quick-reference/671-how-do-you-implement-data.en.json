  "content": "Cloud-native applications are based on containerization and microservice architectures. Data synchronization ensures data consistency in distributed environments, which is crucial for high availability, fault tolerance, and business continuity. Application scenarios include cross-region service coordination, disaster recovery, and real-time data sharing.\n\nIt corely involves distributed databases (such as Cassandra), message queues (such as Kafka), and event-driven mechanisms, with features including eventual consistency models or strong consistency protocols. Practical applications support real-time data updates between microservices, user state synchronization, and disaster recovery backups, significantly enhancing system resilience and operational efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps include: selecting tools such as Debezium or database-native replication; designing event-driven processes to implement data flow; configuring strategies such as Change Data Capture (CDC); and monitoring synchronization performance to ensure reliability. A typical scenario is e-commerce order processing, with business value in reducing the risk of data loss and optimizing user experience."
