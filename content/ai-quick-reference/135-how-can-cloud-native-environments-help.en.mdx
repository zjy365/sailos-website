Cloud-native technologies build and run scalable applications in cloud environments through containerization, microservices, dynamic orchestration, and automated management. Their core value lies in maximizing the utilization efficiency of infrastructure resources, making them suitable for high-concurrency business scenarios that require rapid scaling, and solving the resource waste problem of traditional virtual machine deployment.

The core mechanisms include: Containers provide lightweight process isolation, significantly reducing resource overhead; Kubernetes enables intelligent scheduling (such as Bin Packing algorithm to compact loads) and elastic scaling (HPA/VPA adjustments on demand); Microservice architecture supports fine-grained resource allocation; The Serverless model pays based on actual consumption. These features significantly reduce idle resources and improve overall cluster utilization.

In implementation, resource quotas are defined through declarative deployment, and monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) track metrics in real time to drive automatic scaling. Typical scenarios include web services or batch processing tasks with significant traffic peaks and valleys. After optimization, resource utilization can be increased from less than 20% to 60%-70%, directly reducing hardware costs and simplifying operation and maintenance.
