  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure resources through code. Version control records code changes and enables rollbacks to recover from erroneous deployment states, which is crucial for ensuring consistency, reducing risks, and is particularly widely used in automated CI/CD processes.\n\nThe core includes commit history and tag identifiers from version management systems (such as Git); features involve branching strategies and audit logs. The principle relies on CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Practical applications enhance traceability, collaboration efficiency, and reliability, significantly reducing the impact of failures on DevOps practices.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Version IaC definitions using Git; 2. Integrate CI/CD to test changes; 3. Configure rollback mechanisms (such as reverting commits or using cloud tools). Business value: Minimizes downtime, accelerates recovery, and supports high-availability business continuity."
