In CI/CD pipelines, scaling and load balancing are key technologies for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring reliability. Scaling allows for the dynamic addition of computing resources to handle load peaks, while load balancing distributes tasks to avoid bottlenecks. This is crucial in cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes, supporting high-concurrency builds and deployments to enhance software delivery efficiency.

Core components include auto-scaling mechanisms (such as horizontal scaling groups or cloud service auto-scaling) and load balancers (such as Nginx or cloud load balancing services). Features include triggering scaling based on metrics (such as CPU usage or queue length) and distributing tasks to multiple executors in real-time. In practical applications, this is achieved through Kubernetes' Horizontal Pod Autoscaler or CI tool integration, improving pipeline throughput and reducing the risk of failures.

Implementation steps for handling scaling and load balancing: First, define scaling policies based on monitoring metrics (such as setting thresholds to trigger resource addition); second, configure load balancers to route tasks to available instances; finally, continuously monitor and optimize policies. Typical scenarios include dynamic scaling of Jenkins agent pools or cloud CI services. The business value brought by this includes efficient resource utilization, reduced operational costs, and accelerated software release cycles.
