  "content": "In cloud-native applications, versioned data models refer to managing the change history of data structures and content to ensure compatibility between different versions of the application. Their importance lies in supporting independent deployment, frequent updates, and rollbacks of microservices. Application scenarios include CI/CD pipelines, distributed system migrations, and service scaling.\n\nCore components include: using semantic versioning (such as SemVer) to define schema changes; performing scripted management through database migration frameworks (such as Flyway or Liquibase); features include support for backward compatibility (e.g., adding rather than deleting fields), atomic operations, and audit logs. In practical applications, integration into automated deployment processes enables seamless data upgrades, improving system resilience and operational efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Design a versioning strategy and store change scripts; 2. Automate testing and deployment of migrations during the CI/CD phase; 3. Ensure data compatibility to avoid breaking changes. A typical scenario is synchronizing model changes during rolling updates. Business values include zero-downtime releases, reduced deployment risks, and accelerated iteration frequency."
