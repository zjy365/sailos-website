  "content": "In cloud-native microservices architecture, data encryption is crucial for protecting the confidentiality of data transmission and storage, preventing unauthorized access and leakage. It ensures the security of sensitive information in inter-service communication, database interactions, and API calls, supports compliance (such as GDPR) and business continuity, and is widely used in high-security demand fields like finance and healthcare.\n\nThe core components include transmission encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL to secure data in transit), static encryption (e.g., AES for stored data), and key management tools (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets or HashiCorp Vault). Features include the principle of end-to-end encryption, enabling automation and scalability. In practical applications, service meshes (e.g., Istio) automate TLS, and integrating Vault ensures secure key rotation, significantly enhancing the security of the overall architecture and reducing vulnerability risks.\n\nImplementation steps for handling data encryption: first, enable TLS for all microservice communications; second, manage keys through Secrets tools; finally, enable static encryption for databases and cloud storage. Typical scenarios include microservice API gateway encryption and compliance auditing. Business values include strengthening security posture, reducing data breach costs, and accelerating compliance certification."
