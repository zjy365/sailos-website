  "content": "Implementing Network Segmentation in Kubernetes is a critical security practice that limits the attack surface by controlling network traffic between Pods. This is essential for isolating sensitive applications, meeting compliance requirements (such as PCI DSS), and implementing a zero-trust architecture.\n\nThe core component is the Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resource, which works with CNI plugins that support this feature (e.g., Calico, Cilium, Weave Net). It defines rules based on Labels and Selectors to control allowed ingress and egress traffic. Implementing a default-deny policy is crucial, which explicitly denies all non-essential traffic.\n\nSpecific implementation steps:\n\n1. Audit and Planning: Identify sensitive namespaces (e.g., kube-system, namespaces containing databases) and regular application namespaces.\n\n2. Create and Label Namespaces: Organize resources according to business or security requirements.\n\n3. Apply Default Deny Policy: Create a `default-deny-all` policy in each namespace.\n\n4. Define Allowed Traffic Rules: Create NetworkPolicies to explicitly allow only necessary Pod-to-Pod communication (e.g., frontend -> backend API).\n\n5. Test and Validate: Ensure rules are effective, necessary traffic flows smoothly, and non-essential traffic is blocked."
