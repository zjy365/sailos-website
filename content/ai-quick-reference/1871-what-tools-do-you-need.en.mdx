Cloud-native application monitoring involves continuously collecting application performance data and sending alerts when anomalies occur. It is crucial for ensuring high availability and rapid fault response in cloud-native environments, applied to platforms like Kubernetes to manage dynamic microservice applications.

Core tools include Prometheus (metrics collection), Grafana (visualization dashboards), and Alertmanager (alert management). Features encompass real-time metrics analysis, log aggregation (e.g., Elastic Stack), and distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger). In practical applications, these tools provide system visibility through integration, helping operation and maintenance teams diagnose bottlenecks, reduce downtime, and thereby improve efficiency.

The application of these tools supports real-time health monitoring and rapid problem localization. Their value is reflected in enhancing application reliability, optimizing resource utilization, and reducing costs, helping enterprises maintain business continuity and high-level SLAs.
