APIs serve as the core interface for inter-service interactions in cloud-native applications, enabling loose coupling and automatic scaling of microservices. Their importance lies in supporting portability, elasticity, and rapid iteration, with application scenarios including microservice architectures and containerized environments.

Core components such as RESTful or GraphQL interfaces feature standardized protocols, security authentication, and discoverability; their principles are based on HTTP request and response mechanisms. In practical applications, APIs drive Kubernetes service orchestration and event-driven communication, significantly improving deployment efficiency and system maintainability, with impacts including accelerating DevOps processes and hybrid cloud integration.

The value of APIs lies in optimizing interoperability and agile updates; management is implemented through API gateways such as Istio or Kong, with steps including defining API specifications, configuring authentication, implementing traffic limiting, and monitoring usage. Typical scenarios include improving high-concurrency performance through rate limiting, with business values including cost reduction and enhanced user experience.
