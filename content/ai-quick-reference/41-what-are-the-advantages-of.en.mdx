Container orchestration is the process of automatically managing, scheduling, and running container instances. It is crucial in cloud-native environments as it supports the efficient implementation of microservices architectures. Applied to large-scale distributed systems such as cloud computing and IoT platforms, it can significantly enhance the portability and elasticity of applications.

Core features include automated deployment, load balancing, self-healing, and dynamic scaling principles, with resource scheduling optimization achieved through tools like Kubernetes. In practical applications, it simplifies microservice deployment, promotes DevOps automation, improves operational efficiency, thereby enhancing the scalability and high availability of cloud-native environments and reducing the impact of human errors.

Advantages include: automation simplifies the deployment process; scalability handles peak loads and avoids resource waste; high availability ensures business continuity; resource optimization reduces operational costs; and increased agility accelerates iteration cycles. These directly bring business value such as rapid response to market changes and higher reliability.
