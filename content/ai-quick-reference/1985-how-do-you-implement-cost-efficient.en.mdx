Cloud-native applications are based on containers, microservices, and microservice architectures, running in dynamic cloud environments. Cost-effective scaling strategies achieve elastic scaling of applications through cost optimization. Their importance lies in responding to load fluctuations, avoiding resource waste, and being suitable for scenarios such as e-commerce traffic peaks.

Core components include Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), resource request and limit configurations, and cloud service provider tools like AWS Auto Scaling. Features include automation, pay-as-you-go billing, and cost visibility. In practical applications, optimizing utilization by dynamically adjusting the number of instances reduces costs by up to 30% and improves application availability and efficiency.

Implementation steps: first, define scaling metric thresholds (such as CPU utilization); then deploy HPA or equivalent mechanisms; next, set resource requests and limits; finally, integrate cost monitoring tools. Business values include reducing operational expenses, enhancing performance stability, and supporting agile business growth, with typical scenarios such as handling sudden traffic in streaming media services.
