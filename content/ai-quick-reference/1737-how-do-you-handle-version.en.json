  "content": "Version control for infrastructure-related scripts uses coding management tools such as Git to ensure that script changes are traceable and retrievable. Its importance lies in maintaining the consistency and reproducibility of infrastructure and preventing configuration drift. Application scenarios include resource deployment and automated operation and maintenance in cloud-native environments, supporting efficient collaboration in DevOps processes.\n\nCore components include version control systems (such as Git repositories) and branch strategies, featuring change log recording, code review, and rollback mechanisms. The principle is based on the idea of infrastructure as code, storing scripts and integrating them with CI/CD pipelines. In practical applications, it automates testing and deployment, improves the management efficiency of cloud environments, and its impacts include enhancing team collaboration and reducing the risk of human errors.\n\nImplementation steps include: initializing the script repository, committing changes to specific branches, conducting regular code reviews, and verifying the automated test environment. Typical scenarios are multi-cloud resource provisioning or Kubernetes configuration management. Business values include accelerating deployment iterations, enhancing audit compliance, and reducing operational costs."
