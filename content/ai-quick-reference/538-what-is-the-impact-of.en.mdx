Microservices is a software architectural style that decomposes large applications into small, independently deployable service units. Its importance lies in enhancing development agility, scalability, and system resilience, making it suitable for complex cloud-native environments such as high-traffic e-commerce or financial platforms, and addressing the maintenance and scalability bottlenecks of monolithic architectures.

The core characteristics of microservices include loosely coupled services, lightweight communication protocols (e.g., REST API), and autonomous deployment capabilities. It drives the evolution of architecture from monolithic to distributed, enhances system elasticity, maintainability, and team collaboration by promoting DevOps practices and Kubernetes management, and has a profound impact on the cloud-native ecosystem, such as driving containerization and continuous delivery.

The application value of microservices is reflected in supporting modular innovation, such as rapid iteration of new features; it improves business response speed, optimizes resource usage, and reduces risks, achieving higher flexibility and cost efficiency in the evolution of modern software.
