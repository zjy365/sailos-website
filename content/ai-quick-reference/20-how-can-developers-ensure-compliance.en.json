  "content": "Ensuring compliance in a cloud-native development environment involves adhering to regulations, security policies, and internal standards. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and non-compliance risks, supporting trusted development and DevOps processes. For example, protecting sensitive data in microservices architectures.\n\nCore components include policy definition (such as policy-as-code using Open Policy Agent), automated monitoring and auditing (via tools like Prometheus), and configuration management (like GitOps). Features include enforcing rules through Kubernetes admission control. In practical applications, integrating automated checks into CI/CD pipelines enhances security and efficiency while reducing manual intervention that affects development speed.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define and document compliance policies; 2. Embed automation in development tools (e.g., using linting or admission controllers); 3. Conduct continuous testing and monitoring. A typical scenario is rapid feedback in DevOps. Business values include reducing non-compliance costs, accelerating time-to-market, and maintaining corporate reputation."
