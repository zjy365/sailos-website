Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the automated management of infrastructure, such as cloud resources, through code, enabling repeatability and consistency. Its importance in cost optimization is significant, as it reduces human errors and automatically controls resource allocation. Application scenarios include avoiding over-provisioning in cloud computing deployments.

Core IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation are characterized by declarative configuration, version control, and continuous integration. It automatically scales resources (e.g., instances based on demand) and identifies idle components to reduce operational costs, with impacts including improved resource utilization, reduced waste, and enhanced scalability.

Implementation optimization steps: 1. Define resource requirements and cost policies (e.g., scaling rules) in code; 2. Deploy and automatically scale (e.g., using monitoring to trigger adjustments); 3. Regularly audit to optimize configurations or terminate idle resources. A typical scenario is dynamically adjusting cloud service capacity, with the business value being a significant reduction in expenditures.
