  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, data access auditing refers to tracking all data read and write operations through logging and monitoring mechanisms to ensure data security, compliance (such as GDPR), and prevent unauthorized access. Its importance lies in maintaining the security of microservice architectures and containerized deployments, and it is applicable to scenarios involving sensitive data processing such as finance and healthcare.\n\nCore components include Kubernetes audit policies for defining audit events (e.g., API requests), service meshes (e.g., Istio) for traffic capture, and log aggregation tools (e.g., ELK Stack) for analysis and storage. In practice, the integration of these tools provides end-to-end visibility, effectively enhancing data governance and security response capabilities and supporting dynamic scaling.\n\nImplementation steps: First, configure Kubernetes audit policies to enable event recording; second, deploy agents (e.g., Fluentd) to collect logs into central storage; then use analysis tools (e.g., Prometheus) for monitoring and alarm settings. A typical scenario is monitoring data access anomalies in multi-tenant environments. Business values include risk reduction, compliance optimization, and cost efficiency improvement."
