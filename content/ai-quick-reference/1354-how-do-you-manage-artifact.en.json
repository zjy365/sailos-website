  "content": "Artifact storage refers to the secure preservation of build outputs, such as container images or binary files, in CI/CD pipelines. Its importance lies in ensuring auditability, reducing the risk of repeated builds, and being applied in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes deployments to enhance release reliability and efficiency.\n\nThe core components include artifact repository tools such as JFrog Artifactory or Nexus, which support metadata management, immutable storage, and fine-grained permission control. Features like version tags enable traceability, and semantic versioning is used to handle changes. Practical applications include automatic rollbacks and influencing release pipelines, accelerating iterations, and reducing operational risks.\n\nImplementation steps are: first, select a tool to configure the repository; second, integrate the storage stage into the pipeline and mark versions; third, pull according to the strategy during deployment. A typical scenario is pushing containers to a registry, and the business value is improving stability, reducing failure rates, and optimizing team collaboration costs."
