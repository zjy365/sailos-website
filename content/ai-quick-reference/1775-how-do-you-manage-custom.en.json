  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates cloud resource management using scripts, with custom resource types such as Kubernetes CRDs extending native APIs. Managing them ensures repeatable deployment, consistency, and elasticity of cloud-native applications, suitable for automated configuration and continuous delivery scenarios.\n\nThe core includes defining CRD resource files (e.g., YAML or JSON) and implementing controller logic to handle custom resource states; IaC tools like Terraform or Helm manage these types through declarative configurations. Features involve GitOps workflows and version control; practical applications implement auto-scaling or self-healing capabilities, enhancing system resilience and maintenance efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define CRDs and associated controller code. 2. Integrate IaC tools such as Terraform modules or Helm charts for deployment. 3. Apply version control and audit security policies. Typical scenarios include automated deployment of monitoring components or middleware resources; business values lie in reducing manual errors, accelerating release cycles, and improving team productivity."
