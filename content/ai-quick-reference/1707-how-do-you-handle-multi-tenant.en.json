  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates infrastructure management through code, ensuring resource isolation, consistency, and auditability between tenants when handling multi-tenant configurations. Its importance is prominent in cloud computing and containerization, such as multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, supporting efficient resource sharing and compliance requirements.\n\nThe core includes modular templates, variable injection, and version control tools (e.g., Terraform or Kubernetes CRD). Features like declarative definitions support tenant-customized parameters, implementing isolation mechanisms such as namespaces or policy restrictions. Application scenarios cover isolating tenant environments, reducing configuration drift through automation, and enhancing the security and scalability of multi-tenant systems.\n\nImplementation steps: Design a common base template; Define variables for each tenant (e.g., environment or resource quotas); Use IaC tools to automate deployment and isolate resources (e.g., Terraform workspaces or Kubernetes namespaces). A typical scenario is multi-organization management in a shared cloud environment; Business values include optimized resource utilization, reduced costs, and rapid deployment and maintenance."
