  "content": "Cloud-native data storage is a distributed data management solution designed for large-scale web applications, based on cloud computing elastic architecture to achieve automatic scaling and high availability. Its importance lies in supporting high concurrent access and dynamic loads, with application scenarios including e-commerce platforms, social media and other large-scale web applications to ensure data reliability and performance optimization.\n\nThe core components include service discovery, persistent volume integration, automatic backup and monitoring systems. Cloud database services such as AWS RDS or NoSQL databases are adopted, and deployment orchestration is implemented through Kubernetes Operators or StatefulSets. Features include failure recovery and data partitioning, and practical applications improve DevOps efficiency, with the impact of reducing costs and enhancing application scalability.\n\nImplementation steps: first, select the data storage type (such as object storage or time-series database); second, deploy and configure Kubernetes StatefulSets on the cloud platform; set up automatic scaling policies and disaster recovery backups. A typical scenario is high-traffic web applications, and the business value is to improve reliability, reduce operational complexity and support rapid iteration."
