CI/CD pipelines involve automated integration and deployment processes, which are crucial for cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes. Adhering to regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR or HIPAA) mitigates legal risks and supports the secure delivery of applications in the financial and healthcare industries.

Core components include automated security scanning, audit log tracking, and policy enforcement tools (e.g., Open Policy Agent). Integrating these elements in Kubernetes ensures code integrity, with impacts including improved compliance efficiency and reduced risk of data breaches.

Implementation steps: Identify relevant regulatory requirements; integrate scanning tools (e.g., SonarQube) to test code; automatically generate audit reports to monitor changes. A typical scenario is financial software deployment, with business value in reducing the risk of fines and accelerating the release of compliant products.
