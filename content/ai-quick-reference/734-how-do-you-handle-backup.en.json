  "content": "Distributed cloud-native database backup and recovery strategies ensure the persistence and disaster recovery capabilities of cross-node data, which are crucial for business continuity and compliance, applicable to high-availability scenarios such as financial transactions and e-commerce.\n\nThe core lies in combining logical/physical backups, snapshots, and log streams: first, perform periodic full backups (such as daily snapshots), supplemented by real-time transaction logs (such as WAL) to capture incremental changes. Backup data needs to be stored分散 in object storage (such as S3) or cross-availability zone persistent volumes, and use ETCD to store topology metadata. Point recovery relies on precise replay of log timestamps, while global recovery requires coordinating consistent states between nodes.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Define RTO/RPO targets; 2) Configure automatic snapshot and log archiving tools (such as Velero or cloud vendor native services); 3) Regularly verify the recovery process; 4) Test fault tolerance through Chaos Engineering. The value lies in minute-level recovery (RPO≈0), multi-region disaster recovery, and cost optimization (hot-cold tiered storage)."
