Optimizing infrastructure and resource management in CI/CD involves using automation and strategies to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure stability, which is crucial for achieving fast and reliable software delivery.

The core lies in implementing infrastructure as code to standardize environments, integrating auto-scaling mechanisms to allocate resources on demand, and adopting containerization and orchestration technologies to achieve lightweight isolated deployment. In practical applications, this reduces environment differences, optimizes resource utilization, and accelerates pipeline execution, such as using Kubernetes to start test Pods on demand.

The specific steps are as follows: 1. Use Ansible, Terraform, etc. to implement IaC management environment; 2. Configure monitoring-driven scaling policies such as K8s HPA; 3. Containerize build and test tasks; 4. Implement resource cleanup strategies to回收闲置实例. This reduces computing costs by 20%-50%, shortens release cycles and improves system resilience.
