  "content": "High availability refers to a system's ability to maintain continuous service during failures, which is crucial for cloud-native applications to ensure business continuity, especially applicable to critical scenarios such as e-commerce and finance to avoid downtime losses.\n\nCore principles include redundant architecture, automatic failover, and health monitoring, such as Kubernetes' replica sets, readiness probes, and persistent storage, which optimize resource utilization and enhance resilience through self-healing, significantly improving system fault tolerance and user experience.\n\nOptimization steps: Deploy multiple application replicas on different nodes, configure readiness and liveness probes for real-time monitoring, and combine load balancers to distribute traffic; typical scenarios include cross-availability zone distribution to achieve zero-downtime updates; business value lies in enhancing reliability and reducing revenue interruption costs."
