Cloud-native observability tools are monitoring frameworks that integrate logging, metrics, and tracing components to real-time monitor application behavior in containerized environments. Their importance lies in ensuring application resilience and performance, suitable for dynamically scalable cloud platforms like Kubernetes clusters to handle load changes and enhance system reliability.

Core components include Prometheus (metrics collection), Loki (log aggregation), and Jaeger (distributed tracing), based on the principles of dynamic data collection and correlation analysis. By monitoring metrics such as resource utilization, request rates, and latency, they evaluate application scalability, thereby supporting autoscaling decisions, improving system stability, and operational efficiency. For example, in microservice architectures, they automatically detect bottlenecks and potential scaling points.

Implementation steps include: deploying the observability tool stack; configuring applications to export key metrics; setting up alert rules and autoscaling policies (e.g., Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler); analyzing data to optimize scaling thresholds. A typical scenario is automatically scaling the number of instances during traffic peaks, with business values involving cost optimization, low-latency responses, and high availability guarantees.
