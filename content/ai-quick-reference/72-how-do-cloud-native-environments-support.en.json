  "content": "Cloud-native environments are built on containerization, microservices, and declarative APIs. The key to supporting hybrid cloud deployment lies in their infrastructure abstraction and standardization capabilities. By decoupling applications from the underlying environment, cloud-native technologies can run seamlessly across public clouds, private clouds, and edge environments, addressing core hybrid cloud needs such as data sovereignty, cost optimization, and elastic scaling.\n\nCore components like Kubernetes provide a unified container orchestration layer to ensure application deployment consistency; service meshes (e.g., Istio) manage cross-cloud service communication; and the Operator pattern automates multi-cloud operations. Features include Infrastructure as Code (IaC), continuous deployment (GitOps), and self-healing capabilities, enabling centralized management of resource scheduling, traffic governance, and security policies in hybrid clouds, significantly reducing multi-cloud complexity.\n\nPractical implementation steps are: first, use Kubernetes to standardize application packaging (container images) and declarative deployment (YAML manifests); second, deploy multi-cloud management tools (e.g., Rancher, Anthos) to unify the management of dispersed clusters; finally, implement cross-cloud service discovery and secure communication through service meshes. This delivers business value: avoiding vendor lock-in, optimizing resource utilization (e.g., bursting to public clouds), enhancing disaster recovery capabilities (cross-cloud redundancy), and accelerating compliance adaptation."
