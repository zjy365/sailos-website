Cloud-native development is an approach to building applications using cloud computing service models, which centrally involves microservices, containerization, and automation technologies. Its importance lies in improving development efficiency and system resilience, and it is widely applied in high-availability business scenarios. The cost-saving advantage mainly stems from resource optimization and simplified operation and maintenance.

Key components include container engines (such as Docker) that provide environmental consistency, and orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes) that support automatic scaling and self-healing. Features like elastic resource allocation and continuous deployment reduce manual intervention. In practical applications, dynamic scaling avoids over-provisioning, automated repairs and streamlined teams reduce infrastructure and operational overheads.

These advantages reduce hardware expenditures through efficient resource utilization, accelerate iterations to lower time costs, helping enterprises save money and enhance competitiveness.
