  "content": "Data leakage prevention in cloud-native applications involves preventing unauthorized outflow of sensitive data and ensuring data privacy and integrity. Its importance lies in the distributed nature of cloud-native architectures such as microservices and Kubernetes, which increases leakage risks; application scenarios include highly sensitive fields like financial transactions and medical record processing.\n\nThe core components include policy-driven controls, encrypted transmission and storage, access management tools, and real-time monitoring mechanisms. The principle is based on policy engines implementing network isolation and zero-trust models, such as managing credentials through Kubernetes Secrets or controlling data flow via service meshes; the practical impact is enhancing the overall security posture, reducing compliance risks and operational costs.\n\nImplementation steps include: defining data classification policies; deploying DLP tools to scan data; configuring access control with the least privilege model; enabling encryption such as TLS and storage encryption; and continuous audit logging. Typical scenarios include setting up API gateways to validate data input and output. Business value lies in protecting intellectual property, ensuring regulatory compliance, and user trust."
