Canary testing is a progressive deployment strategy that gradually rolls out new versions to a subset of users in the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) of microservices. Its importance lies in reducing deployment risks by validating on a small scale to ensure service stability and avoid global failures. Application scenarios include safely releasing new features to user groups, commonly seen in high-availability e-commerce or financial systems.

The core components include traffic routing (such as the service mesh tool Istio), monitoring metrics (such as error rates and latency), and automated rollback mechanisms. It is characterized by gradual exposure through configuring percentage allocation or user group policies. Practical applications implement automated deployment through CI/CD pipelines, improving system reliability and reducing release downtime.

Implementation steps: First, define the canary strategy in CI/CD; second, use tools like Argo Rollouts to configure traffic splitting; then monitor key metrics; finally, decide to fully scale up or roll back failed deployments. The business value is to reduce the impact of failures and accelerate the innovation cycle.
