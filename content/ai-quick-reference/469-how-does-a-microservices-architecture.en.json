  "content": "Microservices architecture is an approach that splits a software system into small, independently deployable services, each focusing on a single business function. Its importance lies in enhancing development agility and system scalability, making it suitable for large distributed applications such as e-commerce platforms, supporting rapid iteration and fault-tolerant deployment.\n\nThe core characteristics are service independence, autonomy, and decentralized decision-making, which directly drive changes in team structure: teams need to be organized into small, cross-functional units based on service boundaries, with each team responsible for the entire lifecycle of the service. In practical applications, this model reduces cross-team coordination, improves decision-making efficiency, promotes domain-driven design, and results in a shift from centralized large teams to distributed autonomous units.\n\nImplementation steps include reorganizing teams into autonomous groups with service ownership, strengthening end-to-end responsibility and continuous delivery practices. A typical scenario is when various teams within an enterprise work in parallel, reducing bottlenecks. The business value lies in accelerating market response, enhancing innovation capabilities and system resilience, and enabling flexible resource allocation and fault isolation."
