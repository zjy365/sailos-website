Security monitoring is the process of continuously monitoring system status to detect security threats, while the DevOps pipeline is an automated software delivery process. Integrating the two to build a DevSecOps culture ensures security shifts left and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities being exposed in the production environment. Its importance lies in enhancing software security and compliance, applicable to CI/CD environments such as cloud-native application delivery, enabling risk control during rapid iterations.

Core components include automated security tools (such as SAST/DAST scanning, container scanning) and monitoring systems (such as Prometheus, ELK Stack), embedded in various stages of the pipeline through APIs or plugins. Features include real-time vulnerability feedback and response mechanisms, with the principle of integrating pre-positioned security checks (development phase) and runtime monitoring. In practical applications, scans are automatically triggered during the integration, build, or deployment phases. The impact is reducing the rate of security incidents, shortening the remediation cycle, and improving team security literacy.

Implementation steps: 1) Select and integrate security tools (such as SonarQube) into CI/CD platforms (such as Jenkins). 2) Set up security gates to perform scans at critical stages (such as after building). 3) Configure alert channels to notify of anomalies. 4) Regularly review policies for optimization. Typical scenarios include application deployment monitoring in cloud environments; business values include reducing vulnerability remediation costs, accelerating compliance certification, and enhancing user trust.
