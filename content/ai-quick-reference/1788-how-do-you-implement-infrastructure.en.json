  "content": "GitOps workflow is a Git-based operational method that uses version control systems to manage infrastructure and application deployments, while IaC (Infrastructure as Code) defines and provisions resources such as virtual machines or networks through code. Its importance lies in ensuring consistency, auditability, and automation, reducing human errors, and it is suitable for cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes configuration management.\n\nThe core of GitOps includes Git repositories as the single source of truth, and automated operators (such as Flux or Argo CD) that monitor changes and synchronize cluster states, with features of declarative configuration and instant feedback. IaC involves tools like Terraform to write resource definition files, automating the creation and updating of infrastructure. In practical applications, the combination of the two realizes the full lifecycle management of infrastructure as code, significantly improving deployment reliability and simplifying audit processes.\n\nImplementation steps: first write infrastructure configuration files using IaC tools; store the code in a Git repository; configure GitOps operators to connect the repository with the target environment; automate deployment and verify the state. Typical scenarios include quickly setting up test environments for cloud services. The business value is to reduce operational risks, accelerate iteration, and improve resource utilization."
