  "content": "Microservices architecture decomposes applications into small, independent services, emphasizing loose coupling and scalability. For legacy systems, it facilitates modernization, reduces monolithic limitations, improves maintainability and deployment efficiency, and is suitable for cloud-native migration and enterprise digital transformation scenarios such as e-commerce or financial services.\n\nCore features include clear service boundaries, independent deployment, and API-driven communication. By refactoring legacy components through an incremental approach or adding service wrapper layers, microservices isolate failures, simplify the integration of new functions, significantly enhance system flexibility and observability, and reduce overall system risks.\n\nImplementation steps: Identify high-value module boundaries, containerize microservices, and adopt Kubernetes for orchestration and management. Typical business values include reducing operational costs, accelerating innovation response, and supporting agile development and continuous delivery."
