  "content": "In microservice-based systems, inter-service communication security is crucial because services interact over networks, expanding their exposure surface, and vulnerabilities in a single service can affect others. It ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and the authenticity of service identities, serving as a key component in meeting compliance requirements (such as GDPR, PCI-DSS) and preventing data breaches and man-in-the-middle attacks, primarily applied in scenarios like API calls and event delivery.\n\nThe core of ensuring security lies in authentication, authorization, transmission encryption, and auditing. The main approaches include:\n\n1. Mutual TLS (mTLS): Assigning identity certificates to services to enforce bidirectional verification and encryption for inter-service communication.\n\n2. Service meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd): Transparently managing mTLS, traffic policies, and observability at the infrastructure layer to simplify implementation.\n\n3. API gateways: Acting as unified entry points to handle authentication (e.g., JWT/OAuth2), rate limiting, and routing.\n\n4. Zero Trust Architecture: Defaulting to distrust internal network traffic and enforcing fine-grained authorization (RBAC/ABAC).\n\nImplementation steps mainly involve: deploying a service mesh (e.g., Istio Sidecar proxy injection); configuring service identities (e.g., binding certificates to Kubernetes Service Accounts); enforcing mTLS; defining identity-based access control policies on the mesh or API gateway; and centralizing log auditing. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, strengthens defense-in-depth, simplifies security policy management, and enhances overall system resilience and compliance."
