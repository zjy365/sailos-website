Public and private keys are key elements of asymmetric encryption, used for authentication, secure communication, and data protection. In cloud-native environments, they are crucial as they support the security requirements of dynamic scaling and distributed architectures, such as inter-container API authentication and data encryption, ensuring resource access control and overall system protection.

Core components include key generation, secure storage, rotation, and access control; features are high security and automation. The principle is based on private key confidentiality and public key sharing, applied in Kubernetes secrets management or service mesh security, significantly enhancing attack defense and facilitating compliance.

Best practice implementation steps: adopt dedicated key management systems (such as AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault), regularly and automatically rotate keys, restrict least privilege access, and integrate with tools like Cert Manager. Business values include reducing security risks, efficiently managing the lifecycle, and supporting regulatory compliance.
