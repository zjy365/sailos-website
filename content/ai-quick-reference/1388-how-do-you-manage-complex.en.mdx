CI/CD pipeline is the core process for automating software building, testing, and deployment, ensuring that code changes are delivered quickly and reliably. Complex integration refers to the connection of multiple services or external systems, which is crucial for efficiency and stability in modern cloud-native architectures such as microservice deployments and is often used to accelerate product iteration.

Core components include pipeline orchestration tools (e.g., Jenkins or GitLab CI), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and service mesh management. Features involve environment isolation, dependency coordination, and end-to-end testing, such as using Helm charts or Argo CD to handle Kubernetes cluster deployments to enhance system availability and reduce failure risks.

Implementation steps: 1) Define clear pipeline stages: build, test, deploy; 2) Integrate IaC tools like Terraform to manage environments; 3) Implement automated integration testing and monitoring; 4) Use service discovery tools to coordinate dependencies. Typical scenarios include cross-team collaborative microservice deployment, with business values of shortening time-to-market, improving reliability, and reducing human errors.
