  "content": "Building serverless applications using cloud-native environments involves leveraging their elasticity, programmable infrastructure, and service-oriented components (such as Function-as-a-Service - FaaS, managed services). The key value lies in completely eliminating the burden of infrastructure management, enabling event-driven execution, millisecond-level auto-scaling, and a pay-as-you-go model, suitable for scenarios like API backends, event processing, and data processing.\n\nCore technologies include: 1) FaaS platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Knative on K8s) that execute code snippets in response to events; 2) event sources and triggers (e.g., message queues, storage object changes, HTTP requests); 3) cloud-native services (databases, caches, API gateways); 4) service meshes (for governing communication). The architecture follows the principles of statelessness and short lifecycle, enabling agile development through fine-grained functional modules, significantly reducing operational complexity and costs.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Select and integrate a cloud-native FaaS platform; 2) Decompose the application into independent functions; 3) Configure event sources as triggers (e.g., object storage changes triggering data processing functions); 4) Write stateless function code; 5) Use managed services to store state (e.g., object storage, databases); 6) Deploy and configure auto-scaling. Business value: zero server operations, millisecond-level elastic scaling, pay-per-request/resource consumption, and accelerated innovation delivery speed."
