  "content": "Container image security scanning refers to the process of analyzing software components in container images for vulnerabilities, malware, and configuration risks. It is crucial as it prevents vulnerable images from being deployed into production environments and is applied in CI/CD pipelines, image registries, and runtime security protection.\n\nCore tools include: 1. Open-source tools: Clair (static analysis, integrated with Quay/GitLab), Trivy (fast scanning of images/file systems), Anchore Engine (policy customization); 2. Commercial platforms: Snyk Container (DevOps integration), Prisma Cloud (full lifecycle protection), Aqua Security (in-depth inspection); 3. Cloud services: AWS ECR scanning, GCP Container Analysis. These tools achieve risk identification through CVE database matching, dependency analysis, and sensitive information detection.\n\nImplementation requires: 1) Integrating scanners into CI pipelines (e.g., Jenkins/GitLab CI); 2) Setting policies to automatically block high-risk images; 3) Regularly scanning inventory images in registries; 4) Linking with runtime security tools (e.g., Falco). Typical values include support for compliance audits, shifting supply chain security left, and reducing vulnerability remediation costs by 90%+. For example, Trivy can quickly generate a vulnerability report using the command `trivy image [image name]`."
