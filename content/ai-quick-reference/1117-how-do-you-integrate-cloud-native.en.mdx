Cloud-native databases are database services designed for cloud environments, supporting elastic scaling and containerized deployment; multi-cloud environments involve the collaborative work of multiple cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. Integration is crucial as it enhances business continuity and resilience, avoids vendor lock-in, and is suitable for globalized applications and disaster recovery scenarios.

Core components include container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, standardized APIs, and data synchronization mechanisms (such as cross-cloud replication), characterized by automatic scaling and high availability. In practical applications, it can achieve cross-cloud data consistency, improve resource utilization, and impact the cloud-native ecosystem by promoting microservice architectures and cost optimization.

Implementation steps: First, select compatible databases such as managed services or Kubernetes-native solutions; second, configure multi-cloud management platforms such as cluster federation and network security; then use data replication tools to ensure synchronization; finally, monitor performance. Typical scenarios include hybrid cloud disaster recovery, with business value enhancing flexibility and reducing downtime risks.
