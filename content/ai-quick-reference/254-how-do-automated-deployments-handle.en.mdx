Configuration drift refers to the deviation of system configurations from the expected state over time, endangering environmental consistency and reliability. Correctly addressing drift is crucial in automated deployment to ensure system stability. Application scenarios include continuous deployment in cloud-native platforms such as Kubernetes to prevent error propagation.

The core mechanism relies on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or configuration management tools like Ansible, defining the target state through declarative configurations. The principle is that the deployment engine automatically compares the actual state with the defined state, and triggers correction logic after detecting discrepancies. Practical application significantly reduces human intervention, enhances predictability in containerized environments, and supports zero-downtime updates.

Processing steps: 1. Use IaC to define configuration versioning. 2. Integrate monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) to regularly scan for drift after deployment. 3. Automatically trigger correction actions such as redeployment or rollback. Business values include increasing deployment efficiency by 30%+, reducing failure rates, and enabling elastic scaling.
