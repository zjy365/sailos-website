Performance testing evaluates the responsiveness of a system under specific loads, and an automated deployment pipeline enables continuous integration and delivery. Integration ensures that the software meets performance metrics before going live, avoids bottlenecks in the production environment, and improves stability and resource efficiency in cloud-native scenarios such as Kubernetes clusters.

The core of this integration is adding a testing phase to the pipeline, using tools like JMeter or Locust to script performance scenarios, and triggering automated execution through CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI). The principle is to analyze metrics like throughput and latency, generate reports to feed back to decision gates, and implement continuous monitoring to prevent resource waste caused by inefficient deployments.

Implementation steps include: defining performance test scenarios and metric thresholds, integrating their scripts into pipeline configurations, and setting failure blocking for deployments; the value lies in improving software reliability, reducing production failures, optimizing cloud costs, and being suitable for high-frequency release businesses.
