In cloud-native observability, log aggregation refers to the process of centrally collecting, transmitting, and storing log data generated by distributed applications and scattered across multiple locations (such as containers, nodes, and services) into a unified platform (such as Elasticsearch, Loki, S3). Its core goal is to solve the problem of data fragmentation, establish a foundation for subsequent processing, and rely on collectors like Fluentd and Logstash to achieve stable transmission and storage.

Log analysis is the process of performing in-depth processing on aggregated log data, including indexing, parsing structured fields, correlated queries, pattern recognition (such as error patterns, performance bottlenecks), and visualization (such as Grafana dashboards). Its core value lies in transforming raw text into actionable insights—for example, diagnosing the root cause of failures, monitoring security threats, or understanding user behavior patterns—and relies on tools like Elastic Stack and Splunk to achieve intelligent retrieval and statistics.

The relationship between the two is progressive and collaborative: aggregation ensures data integrity and accessibility, serving as the infrastructure guarantee for analysis; analysis focuses on mining and extracting data value to drive operational decisions. In practice, it is necessary to first deploy a reliable aggregation pipeline, then release business value through analysis tools, together forming a key pillar of observability.
