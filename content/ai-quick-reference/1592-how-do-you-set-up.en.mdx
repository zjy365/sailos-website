Observability involves collecting system runtime data (such as logs, metrics, traces) to monitor performance and behavior. It is crucial in enterprise cloud-native systems, ensuring high availability, rapid fault diagnosis, and resource optimization, applicable to performance analysis of microservice architectures and SLA保障.

Core components include logs (event records), metrics (performance quantification), and traces (request path mapping), characterized by real-time performance and comprehensive coverage. Through unified integration of tools like Prometheus (metrics), Loki (logs), and Jaeger (traces), rapid root cause analysis is achieved in applications, with impacts including reduced MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) and improved operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1) Select tools such as Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger; 2) Deploy agents in Kubernetes pods; 3) Unify visualization and alerting through Grafana; 4) Set thresholds and automated responses. Business values include enhanced system reliability, reduced operational overhead, and improved user experience.
