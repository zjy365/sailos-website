  "content": "Cloud-native development optimizes the entire process of application building, deployment, and operation and maintenance through technology stacks such as containerization, microservices, CI/CD, and declarative infrastructure, significantly improving delivery speed. Its core lies in standardized environments and automated operation and maintenance, which are crucial in modern agile development and continuous delivery scenarios.\n\nIts core is to achieve environmental consistency through container encapsulation, eliminating differences between development and production environments; microservice architecture decouples applications, enabling components to be independently developed, deployed, and scaled; automated CI/CD pipelines enable continuous integration and rapid release; orchestration tools such as Kubernetes provide elastic scaling, self-healing capabilities, and unified management. These features significantly reduce manual operations and cross-team coordination.\n\nThe practical path is: 1. Containerize applications to encapsulate dependencies; 2. Adopt microservices to split business modules; 3. Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated build and testing; 4. Use Kubernetes for declarative deployment and operation and maintenance. This enables minute-level releases, rapid iterations, and fault recovery, shortening the market response cycle and reducing business risks."
