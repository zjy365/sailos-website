The CI/CD pipeline for cloud-native applications automates software building, testing, and deployment processes, serving as the core mechanism to ensure rapid iteration and reliable delivery. It is crucial in containerized, microservices, and cloud environments, reducing human errors, increasing release frequency, and being widely applied in agile development and DevOps practices.

Key components include source code management (e.g., Git), CI servers (e.g., Jenkins), automated testing frameworks, container image registries (e.g., Docker Hub), deployment orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes and Argo CD), monitoring and logging systems, and security scanners. The integration of these components enables automated building, seamless deployment with test validation, ensuring high-frequency releases and zero-downtime updates, effectively supporting rolling upgrades and disaster recovery, and significantly shortening delivery cycles.

These components provide continuous value for cloud-native applications, such as enhancing system resilience, business agility, and scalability, enabling enterprises to quickly adapt to market changes and improve overall competitiveness.
