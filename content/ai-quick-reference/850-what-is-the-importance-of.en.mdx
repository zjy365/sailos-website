Vulnerability scanning identifies security weaknesses in software, containers, or infrastructure. In cloud-native environments, its importance stems from protecting highly dynamic, distributed systems against attacks; application scenarios include container image inspection, runtime monitoring, and security compliance assurance in continuous deployment, ensuring the security of fast-iterating environments.

Core components include image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy), configuration auditing, and runtime detection. The principle is based on automated identification of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerabilities. Practical applications involve integrating DevSecOps pipelines (such as Kubernetes admission controllers) to strengthen security posture, with impacts including reducing the attack surface, enhancing resilience, and supporting industry regulatory compliance.

Application value includes preventing data breaches, reducing the risk of business disruption, and accelerating security patch deployment. This improves the overall reliability of cloud-native environments, promoting business continuity and trust.
