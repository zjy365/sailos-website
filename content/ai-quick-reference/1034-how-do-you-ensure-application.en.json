  "content": "Application consistency in multi-cloud environments refers to the uniform operational status of applications across different cloud platforms, avoiding behavioral deviations caused by infrastructure differences. Its importance lies in supporting scenarios such as hybrid cloud deployment and disaster recovery migration, ensuring business continuity and portability.\n\nThe core implementation requires a three-tier architecture: 1) Containerization encapsulation (e.g., Docker) to isolate applications from the underlying environment; 2) Kubernetes to provide a unified orchestration layer, managing the application lifecycle through declarative APIs; 3) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform) to standardize cloud resource configurations. Key technologies include cross-cloud cluster management, GitOps continuous deployment, and service mesh traffic control.\n\nPractical steps:\n\n1. Adopt a unified image repository to distribute container images;\n\n2. Write cloud-agnostic K8s deployment manifests;\n\n3. Synchronize cloud infrastructure configurations through IaC templates;\n\n4. Deploy GitOps tools such as ArgoCD to enable configuration drift detection and automatic repair. The value lies in reducing the risk of cloud vendor lock-in, improving failover efficiency, and simplifying运维流程."
