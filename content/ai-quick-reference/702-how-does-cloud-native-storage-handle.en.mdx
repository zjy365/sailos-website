Cloud-native storage is a storage solution optimized for cloud-native applications, designed with containerization and microservice architectures. Its importance lies in providing high performance and elastic scalability, supporting the needs of high-throughput data processing, such as real-time big data analytics, AI/ML workloads, and streaming data processing scenarios, ensuring low latency and reliability of applications.

Core components include CSI plugins, distributed file systems, and object storage, with features such as horizontal scalability, low-latency access, and data consistency mechanisms. The principle achieves high IOPS through data sharding, replication, and concurrency optimization. In practical applications, integrating such storage in Kubernetes clusters can efficiently handle massive streaming data, significantly improving processing speed and reducing costs.

Implementation steps include deploying CSI drivers, creating scalable persistent volumes, and configuring storage classes for IOPS-intensive tasks. Typical scenarios include using Ceph or cloud services to optimize network bandwidth and caching strategies, with business values covering accelerated insight generation, reduced latency, and resource overhead.
