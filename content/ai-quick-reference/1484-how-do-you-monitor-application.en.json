  "content": "Real-time monitoring of application response time involves continuously measuring the time taken to process requests to ensure stable service performance. Key terms such as response time (request processing latency) are critical to user experience, with application scenarios including e-commerce and API services to prevent revenue loss or downtime caused by high latency.\n\nCore components include metric collectors (e.g., Prometheus exporters), time-series databases (e.g., InfluxDB), and visualization dashboards (e.g., Grafana). Features encompass low-latency data processing and threshold setting. In Kubernetes environments, integration via sidecar proxies or service meshes (e.g., Istio) enables automatic scaling and real-time fault diagnosis, optimizing resource utilization.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy monitoring agents to capture endpoint latency; configure real-time dashboards to display metrics; set up alert mechanisms to respond to timeout events. Business values include improving user satisfaction, reducing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and ensuring Service Level Agreements (SLA), supporting efficient operational decision-making."
