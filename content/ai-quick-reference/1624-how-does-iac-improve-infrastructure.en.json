  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) manages and automates infrastructure deployment through code, ensuring consistency and repeatability while enhancing security and compliance. Its importance lies in reducing human errors and enabling policy standardization; application scenarios include continuous deployment in cloud environments and governance frameworks.\n\nCore components include reusable templates, state tracking, and automation tools like Terraform. The principle is to define infrastructure as versioned assets and enforce security and compliance rules. In practical applications, IaC automatically scans for vulnerabilities and embeds policies such as network isolation, reducing exposure risks, ensuring audit traceability, and significantly enhancing security posture and compliance certification efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: First, use IaC tools to define the infrastructure; second, integrate security checking tools to detect vulnerabilities; third, enforce compliance rules through policy as code; finally, continuously monitor audit logs. Typical scenarios involve automatic verification in CI/CD pipelines. Business value includes cost reduction, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced risk management."
