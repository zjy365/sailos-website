  "content": "Integrating security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline refers to embedding SAST, DAST, or IAST tools into the automated build and deployment process to ensure security scans are performed with every code change. Its importance lies in detecting vulnerabilities early, reducing production environment risks, and improving development efficiency. Application scenarios include agile development and cloud-native environments to implement shift-left security.\n\nCore components involve configuring CI/CD stages (such as triggering SAST after build or DAST before deployment), and the principle is to achieve continuous scanning through automation scripts or toolchains (like Jenkins plugins or GitHub Actions). In practice, tools such as Snyk or OWASP ZAP are used to analyze code and runtime vulnerabilities, with impacts including reducing remediation costs, strengthening DevSecOps, and meeting compliance requirements.\n\nImplementation steps include selecting tools (e.g., SAST for source code); integrating into pipeline files (such as adding steps to CI YAML); setting trigger conditions (commit or build events); and defining failure policies (failure to中断流程). Typical scenarios: SAST in the development phase and DAST in pre-production. Business value includes accelerating secure delivery, enhancing system resilience, and reducing data breach risks."
