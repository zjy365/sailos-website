Cloud-native storage is a scalable storage service designed for containerized and microservice architectures. Ensuring performance is crucial in time-sensitive applications (such as real-time transactions or video streaming) to avoid business disruptions caused by latency, which can impact user experience and revenue.

The core components include distributed storage systems (e.g., Ceph), local SSD optimization, low-latency network protocols, and automatic data replication. Features involve high throughput, low I/O latency, and dynamic scalability. After optimization, it can significantly improve the response speed of real-time analytics, support AI inference and IoT data processing, and enhance system reliability.

Implementation steps: First, assess performance requirements; select high-performance storage solutions (such as Kubernetes local volumes); deploy caching strategies (such as Redis); monitor latency metrics (using Prometheus); and continuously optimize network configurations. Business values include ensuring the continuity of real-time services, improving user experience, and reducing operational costs.
