  "content": "In microservices architecture, data consistency refers to maintaining synchronized data states across independent services to avoid risks such as duplicate payments or inventory errors. This is crucial in distributed scenarios like e-commerce order processing or financial transactions, where services typically use private databases leading to transaction fragmentation, requiring ensuring the integrity and correctness of operations.\n\nCore practices include the Saga pattern for coordinating transaction chains, event-driven architecture for asynchronous communication via message queues (e.g., Kafka), and the principle of eventual consistency to support high availability. Features such as compensating transactions for rollback and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for separating read and write operations enhance scalability and fault tolerance. In practical applications, Event Sourcing records event history to trace data changes, widely used in order fulfillment and user authentication scenarios.\n\nSteps for implementing best practices: 1. Adopt the Saga pattern to define transaction steps and compensation logic; 2. Use an event bus to publish-subscribe change events; 3. Implement idempotent operations to ensure retry safety; 4. Establish monitoring and retry mechanisms to manage failures. A typical scenario is inventory deduction linked with settlement services, bringing business values including reducing system coupling, improving disaster recovery capability, and accelerating development cycles."
