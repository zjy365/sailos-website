A service mesh is the foundational layer for managing microservice communication in cloud-native architectures, ensuring authentication, authorization, and encryption of inter-service communication in security. It enhances overall system security and is suitable for zero-trust models, distributed applications, and compliance scenarios.

Its core components include the data plane (such as sidecar proxies) and the control plane, providing mutual TLS, fine-grained policies, and traffic control. This is practically applied to enforce service authentication, prevent data leakage, and simplify security configurations, thereby enhancing application robustness, observability, and compliance.

In terms of security application value, it reduces the risk of network attacks, achieves end-to-end data protection, supports centralized governance, and improves business continuity and trust.
