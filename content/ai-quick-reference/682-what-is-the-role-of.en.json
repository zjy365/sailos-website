  "content": "Microservices are an architectural style that decomposes a monolithic application into loosely coupled, independently deployable small services. They are crucial in cloud-native data management. The core lies in each service owning and managing its own data domain (Domain-Driven Design), achieving isolation of data ownership. This autonomy allows services to evolve independently, select the most suitable data storage technologies for their needs (such as relational databases, NoSQL, caches), and communicate through well-defined APIs (e.g., REST, gRPC) or asynchronous events (e.g., message queues).\n\nThis architecture directly supports the application of cloud-native principles. Microservices are inherently containerizable, facilitating automated orchestration, elastic scaling, and fault isolation using Kubernetes. The loose coupling between services reduces direct dependencies at the database level and data schema coupling, enhancing the overall resilience and maintainability of the system. Service meshes (e.g., Istio) are used to govern inter-service communication and data traffic. Ultimately, this delivers business value: higher agility (teams can develop and deploy independently), greater scalability (services can scale independently), flexibility in technology choices (heterogeneous data storage), and optimization of data consistency and flow through event sourcing/event-driven architectures."
