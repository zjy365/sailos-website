Container networking is the network infrastructure for communication between containers, which is crucial in cloud-native development as it enables service discovery, load balancing, and elastic communication for microservices, supporting efficient operation of applications in dynamic, scalable environments. Application scenarios include microservice deployment in Kubernetes clusters and continuous delivery pipelines.

Core components include Container Network Interface (CNI), network policies, and namespace isolation, with features such as dynamic IP allocation, low latency, and cross-host interoperability. In practical applications, it ensures seamless communication between Pods and service exposure, enhancing the reliability, security, and monitoring capabilities of cloud-native applications and facilitating elastic scaling of distributed systems.

The application value lies in providing stable service interconnection, reducing network latency and failure risks; in practice, it supports service meshes (e.g., Istio) to implement traffic control and policy enforcement, thereby optimizing resource utilization, accelerating development iterations, and enhancing business agility.
