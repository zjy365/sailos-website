Protecting cloud-native applications from DDoS attacks is crucial, as DDoS attacks can lead to service disruptions, reduced availability, and data breaches. In cloud-native environments, applications are built on container and microservices architectures, offering elastic scalability but also expanding the attack surface. Protection ensures business continuity and user trust, applicable in scenarios such as e-commerce and API services.

The core components include multi-layered protection: the network layer uses cloud WAF (Web Application Firewall) to filter malicious traffic, and the application layer implements rate limiting and access control. The principle is based on AI detecting abnormal traffic and automatically mitigating it. In Kubernetes, security policies can be configured through Ingress controllers (such as Nginx or Istio service mesh) to enhance system resilience and reduce downtime impact.

Implementation steps: 1) Integrate cloud services (such as AWS Shield or Cloudflare), 2) Configure WAF rules and rate limits, 3) Enable auto-scaling to handle peaks, 4) Continuously monitor logs and develop response plans. A typical scenario is promotion event protection, with business value in ensuring service availability, reducing losses, and enhancing user experience.
