Time-series data refers to records generated over time, such as sensor readings and monitoring metrics, which possess a critical temporal dimension. Processing it in cloud-native environments is crucial because cloud-native architectures (based on containers, Kubernetes, and microservices) offer elastic scalability and high availability, making them particularly suitable for scenarios like Internet of Things (IoT), real-time monitoring, and predictive analytics, enabling efficient handling of massive data streams.

Core components include Time Series Databases (TSDBs), such as Prometheus or InfluxDB, deployed on Kubernetes clusters for automated lifecycle management; features involve efficient indexing, data sharding, and compression mechanisms to support low-latency queries and high throughput. In practical applications, TSDBs are combined with service meshes (e.g., Istio) to handle data ingestion and aggregation, significantly enhancing real-time insight capabilities in areas such as operational monitoring and anomaly detection.

Implementation steps: 1. Select and deploy a TSDB (e.g., using Prometheus Operator); 2. Configure data collectors (e.g., Fluentd or Telegraf) to gather data sources; 3. Design stream processing pipelines (e.g., Kafka + Flink integration); 4. Enable auto-scaling policies. Typical scenarios include cloud infrastructure monitoring; business values include reducing operational costs and accelerating decision support.
