  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, serverless functions refer to event-driven code units that do not require infrastructure management; their orchestration involves automatic deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management. Their importance lies in improving resource efficiency, reducing operational costs, and supporting responsive application scenarios such as real-time data processing, API gateways, and microservice integration.\n\nCore components include event frameworks (e.g., CloudEvents) and orchestration engines (e.g., Knative), with features such as dynamic scaling, cold start optimization, and containerized deployment principles. In practical applications, functions are automatically executed through triggers, with impacts including simplifying event-driven architectures, enhancing development agility, and integrating CI/CD processes to achieve automated workflows.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define function code and containerize it; 2. Deploy to an orchestration platform (e.g., Knative Serving); 3. Configure event sources. Typical scenarios include automatic scaling during traffic peaks, with business values such as cost optimization, rapid response, and efficient resource utilization."
