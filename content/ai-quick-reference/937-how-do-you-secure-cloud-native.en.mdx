JWT (JSON Web Token) is a JSON-based standard token used to implement secure authentication and authorization for APIs. It is crucial for protecting APIs in cloud-native environments, preventing unauthorized access and data forgery attacks. Key application scenarios include cross-API communication between microservices, such as ensuring the security and compliance of data transmission in Kubernetes clusters or API gateways.

JWT consists of three core parts: the header (metadata such as algorithm), the payload (claims such as user information), and the signature (a verification code generated with a private key). It is characterized by being self-contained and stateless, ensuring token integrity and source trustworthiness through a public/private key mechanism. In cloud-native implementations, such as integration via Ingress or service meshes (e.g., Istio), it supports scalable zero-trust architectures, significantly simplifying the authentication process for distributed APIs.

Implementation steps: 1. The server generates and signs the JWT; 2. Client API requests must carry a valid token; 3. The server verifies the signature and claims. Typical scenarios include protecting RESTful APIs in OAuth2 authorization flows. Business values include enhancing API security levels, reducing server state management overhead, and supporting highly available cloud-native deployments.
