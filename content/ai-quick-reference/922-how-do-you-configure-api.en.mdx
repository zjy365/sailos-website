As a secure entry point for cloud-native applications, the API gateway centrally handles authentication, authorization, and traffic control of API requests to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Its importance lies in providing a unified security layer, ensuring compliance, and simplifying API exposure scenarios in microservice architectures, such as Kubernetes environments.

Core components include dynamic routing, authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT or OAuth2), rate limiting, load balancing, and log monitoring, with features supporting policy enforcement and scalability. Through principles like reverse proxy, it integrates with ingress controllers (e.g., Istio or Nginx) in Kubernetes, enhancing overall security and observability, reducing the attack surface, and optimizing performance reliability.

Configuration steps: 1. Select tools such as Envoy or Kong and deploy them at the cluster entry. 2. Define routing rules and backend service mappings. 3. Configure security policies such as TLS certificates and authentication methods. 4. Test and continuously monitor logs. Typical scenarios are applied to the zero-trust model in container environments, with business values including enhanced data protection, support for GDPR compliance, and improved development efficiency.
