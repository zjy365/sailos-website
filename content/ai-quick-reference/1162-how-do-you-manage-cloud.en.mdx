Hybrid cloud platforms integrate public and private cloud resources to enable flexible deployment. Their importance lies in optimizing costs, enhancing elasticity, and ensuring compliance, with applications in enterprise digital transformation, disaster recovery, and multi-regional expansion scenarios.

Its core components include unified resource orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes), automation policies (such as policy-based scaling), and centralized monitoring systems. The characteristics are cross-cloud consistency, elastic scaling, and security integration. In practical applications, this model improves resource utilization, reduces operational costs, and significantly enhances enterprise business agility, disaster recovery capabilities, and compliance control.

Effective management implementation requires following steps: assess cross-cloud requirements and select tools (such as hybrid cloud management platforms); integrate resource APIs; automate deployment and monitoring; and continuously optimize policies. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud workload migration, bringing business values such as 50% cost savings, improved operational efficiency, and risk control.
