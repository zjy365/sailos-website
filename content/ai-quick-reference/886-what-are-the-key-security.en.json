  "content": "Deploying cloud-native applications on Kubernetes poses unique security challenges due to the dynamic, distributed, and ephemeral nature of containers. Ensuring the security of the entire application lifecycle is crucial, spanning development, deployment, and runtime, to protect data and infrastructure and prevent disruptions or compliance risks.\n\nKey challenges include: 1) Container vulnerabilities: Vulnerable images or runtimes are susceptible to attacks; 2) Misconfiguration: Overly permissive RBAC permissions, unrestricted Pod security policies, or incorrect network policies expand the attack surface; 3) Secret management: Hard-coded keys or improper Secret management lead to credential leaks; 4) Supply chain risks: Untrusted registries may introduce malicious images; 5) Workload isolation: The lack of effective network micro-segmentation between Pods allows lateral movement.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires implementing defense in depth. Key measures include: rigorously scanning images and dependency libraries for vulnerabilities, configuring RBAC with the principle of least privilege, encrypting network communications and defining fine-grained network policies, securely storing and rotating sensitive secrets, and verifying the signatures of image sources. These steps can effectively reduce the risk of intrusion, ensure data confidentiality and integrity, and meet compliance requirements."
