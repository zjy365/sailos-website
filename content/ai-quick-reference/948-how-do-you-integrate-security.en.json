  "content": "Containerized applications involve running applications in lightweight containers (such as Docker), while security monitoring detects threats in real-time, ensures compliance, and protects data. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and attacks, applicable to cloud-native environments like Kubernetes clusters.\n\nCore components include runtime behavior monitoring (e.g., using Falco to detect anomalies), vulnerability scanning (e.g., Trivy to assess image risks), and log analysis (integrating ELK Stack). These features prevent intrusions by auditing container activities and network traffic, enhancing overall system security and reliability.\n\nImplementation steps: first deploy security agents (e.g., installing Falco via Kubernetes DaemonSet), configure policies (e.g., role-based access control), regularly scan images, and set up alerts (integrating Prometheus-Alertmanager). Business values include risk reduction, compliance support (GDPR/PCI DSS), and acceleration of secure DevOps processes."
