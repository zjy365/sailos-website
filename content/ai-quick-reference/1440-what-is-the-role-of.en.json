  "content": "Tracing in distributed systems refers to recording the propagation path of requests across multiple services. Its importance lies in revealing the complexity of service dependencies, enhancing observability, and being applied in microservice architectures and cloud-native environments to facilitate debugging and monitoring system behavior.\n\nCore components include trace identifier propagation, span timestamp collection, and service call chain construction. The principle is based on distributed context propagation, allowing aggregation of logs and metric data to enable performance bottleneck identification, root cause analysis of failures, and service dependency mapping, significantly improving system reliability and operational efficiency.\n\nThe role of tracing is to provide end-to-end request visualization, accelerate problem troubleshooting, optimize resource allocation, and enhance service health monitoring, thereby supporting the development and maintenance of highly available cloud-native applications."
