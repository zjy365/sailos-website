Cloud-native applications are designed for cloud environments, based on microservices and containerization, enabling dynamic scaling and automated deployment. Their maintainability ensures high availability, rapid iteration, and cost efficiency, which is particularly crucial in modern cloud computing such as Kubernetes management, suitable for dynamic load scenarios like e-commerce and finance.

Core features include service decoupling, infrastructure as code, and automatic recovery. For example, Kubernetes orchestrates containers to implement rolling updates and self-healing mechanisms, while DevOps practices integrate CI/CD pipelines to improve change traceability. In practical applications, this reduces manual intervention and enhances system resilience.

Implementation steps: Adopt a microservice architecture to decouple components; containerize applications (e.g., Docker); deploy to the Kubernetes orchestration platform; integrate CI/CD tools to automate testing and release; set up centralized logging and monitoring systems; implement automated scaling. Business values include reducing operational costs by over 30% and accelerating the innovation cycle.
