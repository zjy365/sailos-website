Cloud-native storage is designed for cloud environments and containerized applications, emphasizing elasticity, scalability, and automation; traditional on-premises storage, such as direct-attached or SAN devices, is deployed based on fixed hardware. Its importance lies in supporting the dynamic requirements of cloud-native applications, such as rapid scaling and high availability, making it suitable for microservice scenarios managed by Kubernetes.

Core features include distributed architecture, self-healing capabilities, and API-driven integration, enabling dynamic provisioning through CSI (Container Storage Interface). In contrast, on-premises storage is limited to local maintenance and lacks automatic scaling. In practical applications, cloud-native storage supports state persistence, enhances application reliability, promotes DevOps efficiency, and has impacts such as reducing infrastructure complexity.

In terms of applications, cloud-native storage provides persistent support for containers and ensures data consistency; its business value lies in reducing storage costs, enhancing flexibility, improving business agility through automatic elastic scaling, and adapting to multi-cloud and hybrid environments.
