The main challenge in managing a large number of microservices lies in the inherent complexity brought about by their distributed nature. In complex systems, coordinating hundreds or thousands of independently deployed, updated, and scaled services places extremely high demands on service discovery, network communication, data consistency, and overall operation and maintenance. Its importance directly affects the reliability, maintainability, and iteration speed of the system.

Core challenges include: increased complexity in service discovery and dynamic routing; difficulties in managing the reliability and latency of inter-service communication (such as network partitioning, retries, and circuit breaking); challenges in ensuring distributed data consistency (especially cross-service transactions); complexity in coordinating version compatibility and rolling upgrades; significant pressure on orchestration and configuration management due to the sharp increase in deployment frequency; extreme difficulty in full-link monitoring, log aggregation, and fault diagnosis; and heavy burden in optimizing resource utilization efficiency and managing fine-grained security policies.

Addressing these challenges requires relying on robust automation platforms and architectural practices: adopting service meshes (e.g., Istio) to simplify communication governance; utilizing mature CI/CD pipelines for reliable releases; building centralized observability stacks (metrics, logs, tracing); implementing contract testing to ensure interface compatibility; and combining Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with cloud-native platforms to improve operational efficiency. Successful management can enhance system resilience while maintaining the core business values of rapid iteration and innovation.
