Microservices is a distributed architectural style that decomposes an application into a set of small, independent services, each focusing on specific business functions. In contrast, a monolithic architecture builds the entire application as a single, tightly coupled code unit. The importance of microservices lies in enhancing maintainability, scalability, and agility, making them suitable for cloud-native scenarios such as large-scale web services and real-time systems. Monolithic architectures, on the other hand, are easy for initial development but struggle to handle the growth of complex requirements.

Key characteristics of monolithic architectures include a unified codebase, shared database, and centralized deployment, leading to difficulties in scaling and limitations in technological iteration. The core features of microservices are service autonomy, independent deployment, lightweight communication (such as REST or message queues), and database decoupling. In practical applications, microservices support high availability, such as accelerating the launch of new features on e-commerce platforms. Monolithic architectures are used for simple applications but face performance bottlenecks, affecting the development of distributed systems.

The differences between microservices and monolithic architectures are reflected in microservices being more conducive to independent team development, rapid iteration, and fault isolation, bringing business agility and elastic value. Monolithic architectures simplify deployment but restrict scalability. Choosing the appropriate architecture can optimize costs and responsiveness, requiring evaluation based on project scale and dynamic requirements.
