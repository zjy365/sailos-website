IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is an approach to automating the definition and management of infrastructure through code, ensuring consistency and repeatability. It is applied in cloud service deployment to accelerate resource provisioning and reduce human errors.

Its core components include declarative configuration scripts (such as Terraform or CloudFormation), version control systems (such as Git), and CI/CD tools. The principle is to execute code to automatically configure resources, enabling testability and auditability. In practical applications, it optimizes cloud service deployment, significantly improving operational efficiency and reliability, and is suitable for dynamically scalable cloud environments.

Implementation steps: Select an IaC tool (such as Terraform); write infrastructure code to define resources; integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Typical scenarios include continuous delivery environments, with business values of efficient and reliable deployment, reduced costs, and enhanced scalability.
