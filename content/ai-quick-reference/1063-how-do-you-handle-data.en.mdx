Hybrid cloud systems combine private and public cloud resources, and data migration involves transferring data between them. Its importance lies in optimizing costs, enhancing flexibility, and ensuring business continuity; application scenarios include disaster recovery, application migration, and multi-cloud backup.

Core components include dedicated migration tools (such as AWS DataSync or Azure Migrate), security protocols (such as encrypted transmission and VPN networks), and data consistency mechanisms. Features support real-time or batch migration; the principle relies on API integration to achieve efficient synchronization; practical applications help enterprises expand cloud resources, meet compliance requirements, and promote multi-cloud strategies.

Implementation steps: Assess data volume and type; select appropriate migration tools; configure network security (such as encryption policies); perform migration and monitor progress; verify data integrity. Business value: Reduce downtime, lower costs, enhance data protection, and support agile innovation and resource optimization.
