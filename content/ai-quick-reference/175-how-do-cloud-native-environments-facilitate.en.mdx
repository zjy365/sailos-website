Cloud-native environments utilize containerization, microservices, and dynamic orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes) to achieve elastic resource scaling and automated management. Their importance lies in supporting real-time, continuous monitoring needs to ensure high application availability; typical scenarios include performance tracing and fault warning in distributed systems, which improves operational efficiency.

Core components include dynamic service discovery, automatic scaling mechanisms, and built-in monitoring tools (such as Prometheus or Grafana), seamlessly integrated through log collection, metrics, and tracing. These architectural features enhance application visibility and enable rapid anomaly detection, with impacts including increased deployment frequency, optimized resource utilization, and accelerated problem response.

Implementation steps: Integrate cloud-native monitoring tools; configure automated alerts and feedback; connect with CI/CD pipelines. Business value includes improved operational efficiency, reduced downtime, optimized user experience, and cost control, suitable for critical domains such as finance or e-commerce.
