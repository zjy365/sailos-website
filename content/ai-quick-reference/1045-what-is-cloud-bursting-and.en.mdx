Cloud bursting is a dynamic scaling strategy that allows enterprises to automatically migrate workloads to the public cloud during resource peaks to supplement insufficient on-premises capacity. Its importance lies in ensuring business continuity and performance optimization, applied in scenarios with fluctuating traffic, such as e-commerce promotions or seasonal peaks, to enhance user experience and avoid disruptions.

Its core components include on-premises resource pools, public cloud services (such as AWS or Azure), monitoring tools, and auto-scaling mechanisms like Kubernetes orchestrators. The principle is to trigger scaling through real-time load monitoring, with features including seamless integration, on-demand resource allocation, and cost efficiency. In practical applications, this enhances hybrid cloud elasticity, reduces capital expenditures, and supports high-availability service deployments.

In a hybrid cloud environment, the workflow involves the monitoring system detecting on-premises resource constraints, triggering public cloud expansion: automatically deploying additional instances to handle peak loads, and releasing resources after the load decreases. The business value is achieving dynamic scaling, improving application response times, and optimizing costs (paying only for actual usage), with typical scenarios including burst data processing and disaster recovery.
