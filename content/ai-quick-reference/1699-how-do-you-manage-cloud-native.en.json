  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) uses scripts to define and manage infrastructure configurations. In cloud-native environments, it focuses on automating security policies such as network isolation and access control to ensure consistency, auditability, and compliance. It is applied in the deployment of container platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to prevent vulnerabilities and threats.\n\nCore components include IaC tools (Terraform or CloudFormation) and security configuration templates (e.g., Kubernetes Security Contexts). Features involve version control, policy as code, and CI/CD integration. In practical applications, security policies are automatically deployed (such as defining network rules or role permissions), improving compliance, reducing human errors, and achieving unified security governance in multi-cloud environments.\n\nImplementation steps: First, code security configurations (e.g., defining AWS security groups with Terraform); then integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment; finally, use scanning tools (e.g., Checkov) to verify compliance. Typical scenarios include automatically patching vulnerabilities in K8s clusters. The business value is enhancing security posture, accelerating threat response, and complying with regulations such as GDPR."
