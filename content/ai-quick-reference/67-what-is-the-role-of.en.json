  "content": "In cloud-native environments, monitoring refers to the continuous collection and analysis of operational status data (metrics, logs, traces) from distributed systems such as microservices, containers, and Kubernetes clusters. Its importance lies in addressing observability challenges posed by the dynamic and complex nature of cloud-native architectures, supporting system stability, performance optimization, and rapid fault localization. Application scenarios include real-time service health checks, capacity planning, and automated alerting.\n\nCore components include metric monitoring (e.g., Prometheus collecting CPU/memory data), log aggregation (e.g., Fluentd/Loki), distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger), and alerting systems. Key features emphasize real-time performance, multi-dimensional data correlation, and automation. Its application directly impacts DevOps processes: quickly diagnosing bottlenecks through visualization dashboards (e.g., Grafana) to reduce MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery); driving Auto Scaling decisions; ensuring SLA compliance; and providing data support for continuous optimization of microservice performance.\n\nIn cloud-native development, the core value of monitoring is to ensure business continuity and improve development efficiency. Its applications include: real-time detection of service outages to reduce user impact; tracking request chains to identify root causes of cross-service failures; predicting resource requirements based on historical data to optimize costs. Ultimately, it enables DevOps collaboration, accelerates iteration cycles, and ensures user experience and system resilience."
