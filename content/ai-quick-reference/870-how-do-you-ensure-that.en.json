  "content": "Cloud-native applications are software designed for cloud architectures, using containerization and microservices. Ensuring their resilience against cyberattacks is crucial to safeguard business continuity and data security, making them suitable for highly dynamic and distributed Kubernetes environments.\n\nCore components include the zero-trust security model, fine-grained network policies (such as Kubernetes Network Policies), and service meshes (such as Istio), enabling identity-based access control and encrypted communication. Features involve real-time threat detection and adaptive defense. Practical applications include filtering malicious traffic through API gateways, enhancing overall security posture, reducing the attack surface, and accelerating recovery.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Adopt a zero-trust architecture and configure least-privilege access; 2. Deploy a service mesh to control ingress traffic; 3. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and monitor abnormal activities. Business values include improved compliance, reduced downtime risks, and enhanced application resilience and credibility."
