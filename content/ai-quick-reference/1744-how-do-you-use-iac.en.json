  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of automating the definition and management of cloud resources using code, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and reducing human errors. Its importance lies in supporting elastic scaling and rapid deployment, with application scenarios including cloud environment setup, testing, and production operations and maintenance.\n\nCore components include tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, characterized by declarative configuration and version control. The principle is to drive resource changes through code templates. Practical applications automate the creation of VMs, networks, or storage, strengthen DevOps practices, and improve system reliability.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Use tools to write IaC code to define resources; 2. Store in a version repository; 3. Execute the apply command for configuration; 4. Run the destroy command to destroy resources. Typically used in CI/CD pipelines or temporary testing environments; business value optimizes costs, accelerates releases, and enhances auditability."
