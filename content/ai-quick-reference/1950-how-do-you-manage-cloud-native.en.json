  "content": "Cloud-native application log management involves centralized collection, storage, and analysis of application logs in cloud environments for troubleshooting and performance optimization. Its importance lies in the complexity of cloud-native distributed architectures, which require reliable observability to ensure system stability. Application scenarios include real-time monitoring of microservice interactions, debugging errors, and optimizing resource utilization.\n\nCore components include log agents (such as Fluentd or Logstash) responsible for collecting data across nodes, storage layers (such as Elasticsearch or cloud object storage) providing scalable persistence, and analysis tools (such as Kibana or Grafana) enabling visual querying. Features emphasize real-time processing, automated integration, and high availability. In practical applications, this accelerates root cause diagnosis, optimizes resource allocation, and enhances system reliability and compliance.\n\nImplementation steps: first, deploy log collectors and configure output sources; second, select storage solutions and transfer data; third, integrate analysis tools and set up dashboards and alert rules; finally, use logs to perform queries and metric analysis. Typical scenarios include tracing defects through error logs or adjusting resource allocation by analyzing latency data. Business value is reflected in reducing fault repair time, optimizing cloud costs, and improving service availability."
