  "content": "Cloud-native storage is a distributed, elastic storage system designed for containerized and cloud environments, providing high availability, persistence, and dynamic scalability. It is extremely important in blockchain applications, used to support the reliable processing of distributed ledger data and smart contracts, especially suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as decentralized applications and supply chain tracking.\n\nIts core components include StorageClass, Persistent Volume, and dynamic provisioning mechanism. The principle is to use the Kubernetes abstraction layer to achieve storage isolation, snapshot backup, and consistency guarantee. In practical applications, cloud-native storage can significantly improve the data access performance of blockchain nodes, enhance system resilience, reduce downtime risks, and promote transaction efficiency and overall platform manageability.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1) Defining storage requirements through PVC; 2) Selecting cloud provider disks or distributed systems such as Ceph; 3) Integrating encryption tools to ensure data security; 4) Deploying auto-scaling policies. Typical scenarios such as optimizing on-chain data read-write speed bring business values of agile deployment, cost savings, and reliability improvement."
