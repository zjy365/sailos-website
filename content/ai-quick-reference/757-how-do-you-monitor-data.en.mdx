Monitoring data security in cloud-native storage systems involves continuously observing data access, storage, and transmission processes to ensure integrity, confidentiality, and compliance, and to prevent data leakage or misuse. Its importance lies in protecting sensitive information, especially as storage solutions are widely deployed in containerized environments such as Kubernetes, with application scenarios including persistent volume management in e-commerce or financial sectors.

The core components include audit log tracking, encryption mechanisms (such as TLS or end-to-end encryption), access control policies, and real-time monitoring tools. Features encompass automated anomaly detection, policy enforcement engines, and vulnerability scanning, with the principle based on continuous analysis of data flow patterns. In practical applications, such as integrating MinIO or Portworx storage through CSI drivers, monitoring tools like Prometheus or Fluentd can detect unauthorized operations, enhance security, and comply with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.

Implementation steps: First, configure audit logs and centralize them into a SIEM system; second, deploy monitoring agents to track access events and encryption status; finally, regularly scan storage volume vulnerabilities and use alert mechanisms to respond to threats. Business values include reducing non-compliance risks, enhancing customer trust, and optimizing compliance costs.
