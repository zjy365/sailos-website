Terraform state files store infrastructure state, and remote management by Terraform Cloud ensures consistency across environments (such as development, testing, and production), avoids conflicts and human errors, and is suitable for multi-stage continuous deployment scenarios.

Terraform Cloud uses workspaces to isolate state files for each environment. Core features include state locking to prevent concurrent conflicts, version history auditing, and remote storage in cloud backends, supporting integration with automated CI/CD pipelines, thereby enhancing deployment auditability and environment isolation security.

Implementation steps: Create a Terraform Cloud account and organization; define multiple workspaces corresponding to different environments; configure the terraform backend as cloud; run terraform init and apply changes. Typical scenarios include pipelined deployment workflows. The business value is to improve the reliability, efficiency, and security of infrastructure management and reduce the risk of misoperations.
