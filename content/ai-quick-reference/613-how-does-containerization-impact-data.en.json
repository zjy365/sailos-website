  "content": "Containerization packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, but containers are ephemeral and stateless by default. This makes data persistence in container-native environments challenging, especially in microservices and frequently updated scenarios. Ensuring data reliability, consistency, and availability for stateful applications is crucial.\n\nContainerization has profoundly changed data storage management. The core lies in introducing persistent volume mechanisms to decouple the storage lifecycle from the container lifecycle. The Container Storage Interface (CSI) enables standardized access for storage providers. StatefulSets provide ordered deployment, stable network identities, and persistent storage for stateful workloads. Data locality is more critical for performance optimization, and backup and recovery strategies also need to be redesigned to adapt to dynamic environments.\n\nTo address data challenges, it is necessary to clarify application state requirements: stateless services use temporary storage, while stateful workloads must be configured with persistent volumes. In practice, it is necessary to select cloud-native storage solutions or integrate enterprise storage systems through CSI, and allocate persistent volumes for databases, message queues, etc. StatefulSet ensures stable association between Pods and storage. Implementation strategies include formulating PVC policies, selecting appropriate storage backends, and configuring backup solutions to ensure business continuity and obtain elastic scalability in dynamic environments."
