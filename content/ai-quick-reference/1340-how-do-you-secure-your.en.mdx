Cloud-native CI/CD pipelines are core processes that leverage cloud-native technologies (such as containerization and Kubernetes) to automate software building, testing, and deployment. Their importance lies in accelerating delivery, improving development efficiency, and supporting microservices architectures, which are widely used by agile teams to build and deploy cloud applications.

The core components of such pipelines include code repositories, CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins or Argo CD), container registries, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Features like automated workflows and elastic scaling ensure reliability and repeatability. In practical applications, they promote DevOps practices, enabling continuous feedback and quality control, thereby enhancing the robustness of the software development lifecycle and the speed of innovation.

Protection measures include: implementing static and dynamic scanning tools (such as Trivy or Snyk) to detect code and container vulnerabilities; managing authentication through least privilege access and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); hardening base images and application configurations; integrating security gates (e.g., admission controllers) into CI/CD stages; and continuously monitoring logs and runtime behavior. These actions reduce vulnerability risks, ensure compliance, and enhance business continuity, user trust, and market responsiveness.
