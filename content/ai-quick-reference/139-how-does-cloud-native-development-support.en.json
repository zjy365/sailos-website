  "content": "Cloud-native development supports application monitoring and alerting through containerization and microservice orchestration such as Kubernetes, ensuring high availability and real-time fault detection, and is suitable for resource management and system stability maintenance in dynamic cloud environments.\n\nIts core includes Prometheus metric collection, Grafana visualization, and Alertmanager alert processing, supporting automatic service discovery and log aggregation principles to achieve real-time observability of distributed applications. Practical applications are integrated into CI/CD pipelines to improve fault troubleshooting efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy monitoring tools such as Prometheus Operator and configure metric rules; set alert thresholds and notification channels such as Slack. A typical scenario is microservice health monitoring, with business value in reducing MTTR and improving user satisfaction."
