  "content": "In cloud-native environments, authorization is a mechanism that controls user or service access to APIs and resources, ensuring that only legitimate entities can perform operations. Its importance lies in preventing data leakage and unauthorized access, enhancing overall security and compliance. It is widely used in microservice architectures, containerized applications such as Kubernetes clusters, and API gateway integrations.\n\nThe core components of authorization include policy models (such as RBAC or ABAC) and enforcement points (such as API gateways or service mesh proxies), supporting fine-grained control, dynamic policy updates, and context awareness. In practical applications, tools like Istio or Open Policy Agent (OPA) are used to achieve secure isolation between services, enhance observability and trust management, reduce the attack surface, and comply with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR.\n\nHandling authorization involves: first, implementing authentication (such as OAuth2 or JWT); second, defining authorization policies (using YAML configuration or OPA policy language); third, deploying to the enforcement layer (such as API gateway or Istio service mesh); and finally, monitoring and auditing access logs. Typical scenarios include Kubernetes namespace authorization or microservice communication, with business values in reducing risks, improving efficiency, and meeting regulatory requirements."
