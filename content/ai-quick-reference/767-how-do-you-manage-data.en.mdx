Cloud-native databases operate in containerized and microservices architectures, providing elasticity and scalability. Data security and encryption ensure that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access, whose importance lies in complying with privacy regulations such as GDPR and being applied in high-risk scenarios like finance or healthcare.

Core components include Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted communication, encryption of data at rest (e.g., AES-256), and key management systems. The principle involves end-to-end protection, combined with Kubernetes Secrets or tools like HashiCorp Vault to implement key rotation. In practice, it enhances the security of cloud-native applications, reduces the risk of data breaches, and supports compliance audits.

Implementation steps: 1. Enable database-native encryption and integrate key management services (e.g., AWS KMS). 2. Configure network isolation and TLS connections. 3. Deploy Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 4. Set up log auditing and monitoring alerts. Its business value lies in reducing costs, ensuring data integrity, and meeting industry standards such as ISO 27001.
