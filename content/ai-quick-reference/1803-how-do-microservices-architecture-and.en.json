  "content": "Microservices architecture decomposes applications into independent services, enhancing agility and scalability; cloud-native development relies on cloud computing models to optimize resource utilization and deployment speed. The two complement each other and are jointly applied in distributed systems such as e-commerce and financial platforms, supporting high concurrency and rapid iteration, and serving as the core of modern digital solutions.\n\nThe characteristics of microservices architecture include loosely coupled services and API communication, while the core principles of cloud-native include containerization (e.g., Docker), automatic orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), continuous delivery, and observability. In practice, cloud-native tools manage the microservice lifecycle, enabling elastic scaling, fault isolation, and automated operation and maintenance, significantly improving DevOps efficiency and driving business innovation and system resilience.\n\nThe complementary implementation steps are: splitting applications using microservices; containerizing each service; deploying to cloud-native platforms (e.g., Kubernetes); and integrating CI/CD pipelines. Typical scenarios such as online payment systems bring business values including cost optimization, rapid release of new features, high availability, and risk minimization."
