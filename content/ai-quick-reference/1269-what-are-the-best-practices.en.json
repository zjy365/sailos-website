  "content": "In CI/CD pipelines, version control systems like Git manage code change history, ensuring traceability and team collaboration. Their importance lies in supporting rapid iteration and audit tracking, with application scenarios including automated build and release processes.\n\nCore practices include defining strict code branching strategies (such as Gitflow or GitHub Flow), enforcing that all changes undergo review through merge requests, integrating automated testing, and using semantic versioning tags. In practical applications, these features ensure environmental consistency and error isolation, reduce the risk of deployment failures, and enhance reproducibility.\n\nApplication value is reflected in optimizing process efficiency, enabling quick rollbacks and incremental releases through version control, reducing operational costs, and enhancing the overall reliability of CI/CD pipelines and business response speed."
