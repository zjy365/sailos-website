Cloud-native applications are built and run on cloud platforms, utilizing microservices, containerization, and elastic architectures. Optimizing their cost-effectiveness is crucial, as it maximizes resource utilization, reduces over-provisioning waste, and is suitable for dynamic business scenarios such as e-commerce or real-time analytics systems.

Core components include auto-scaling (e.g., Kubernetes HPA), resource monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), and cloud vendor tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer). The principle is based on fine-grained management of computing and storage instances, combined with FinOps practices to adjust deployment strategies. Applications can reduce operational expenses by 30-50% through optimizing instance types and service meshes (e.g., Istio), while improving system reliability and enterprise agility.

Implementation steps: Deploy monitoring tools to identify idle resources; set up auto-scaling policies to match traffic fluctuations; regularly audit the architecture to decommission or integrate services. Typical scenarios include resource optimization during peak periods, achieving significant cost savings and accelerating innovation.
