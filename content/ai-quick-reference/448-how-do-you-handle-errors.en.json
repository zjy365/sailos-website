  "content": "Microservice communication refers to the interaction between independent services in a distributed system. Effectively handling errors and retries is crucial, as it ensures system reliability and fault tolerance. Application scenarios include fault isolation in API calls and message delivery.\n\nCore strategies include timeout detection, retry mechanisms such as exponential backoff, and the circuit breaker pattern. These principles are implemented through exception capturing, automatic retries, or service isolation. In practical applications, they improve system availability and resilience, and prevent cascading failures.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Set reasonable timeout limits. 2. Configure retry strategies (e.g., exponential backoff). 3. Use circuit breakers to temporarily block failed calls. A typical scenario is service requests under network fluctuations. Business values include reducing disruptions and improving user satisfaction."
