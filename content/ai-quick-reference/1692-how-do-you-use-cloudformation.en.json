  "content": "CloudFormation is AWS's declarative service that automates the configuration and management of AWS resources such as EC2 and S3 through code (JSON/YAML templates). Its importance lies in implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring deployment consistency and repeatability, applied in Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) scenarios, and simplifying the infrastructure setup for cloud-native applications.\n\nCore components include template structure (resource definitions, parameters, and outputs), stack concept (unified management of resource groups), and dependency order execution principle. Features include declarative syntax and automatic rollback mechanism. In practical applications, it quickly deploys complex architectures (such as VPC networks or multi-tier applications), improves DevOps efficiency, significantly reduces manual errors, and supports cross-environment replication.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Create a template file to define resource configurations; 2. Use the AWS console or CLI commands to execute deployment; 3. Monitor stack status and handle updates. Typical scenarios include setting up auto-scaling groups or microservices. Business values include reducing operational costs, accelerating time-to-market (from hours to minutes), ensuring security compliance, and high availability."
