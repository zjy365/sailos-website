  "content": "Artificial intelligence plays a key role in cloud-native observability, which refers to monitoring the health of cloud-native applications through logs, metrics, and traces. Its importance lies in supporting efficient operation and maintenance of dynamic environments such as Kubernetes, ensuring system stability and fault recovery. Application scenarios include microservice monitoring, predictive scaling, and resource optimization.\n\nThe core components involve machine learning algorithms analyzing massive amounts of data to enable anomaly detection and automatic root cause diagnosis, with features including reduced real-time alerts and predictive insights. In practical applications, AI integrates with observability tools to quickly identify performance bottlenecks and optimize container clusters, significantly improving the efficiency of automated operations and maintenance and the speed of fault resolution.\n\nIts application value lies in reducing false positives, shortening the mean time to repair, and lowering operation and maintenance costs. This enhances the reliability and sustainability of business systems and supports continuous service delivery."
