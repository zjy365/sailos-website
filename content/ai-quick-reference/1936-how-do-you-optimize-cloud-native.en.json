  "content": "Cloud-native applications are based on containerization and microservice architectures, utilizing cloud computing resources to achieve agile deployment. Optimizing their performance to enhance user experience is crucial, as users rely on fast-response, high-reliability services. Application scenarios include e-commerce platforms or online services, where optimization can reduce latency, increase user satisfaction, and enhance business competitiveness.\n\nCore components include resource scheduling, monitoring systems, and fault-tolerance mechanisms, with features such as elastic scaling and automated management. The principles involve Kubernetes orchestration and CI/CD pipelines to achieve efficient resource utilization. In practical applications, optimization can reduce service latency, improve application stability, and directly impact user retention and brand loyalty.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Configure real-time performance monitoring such as Prometheus; 2) Adjust container resource requests/limits; 3) Enable auto-scaling mechanisms; 4) Integrate CDN to accelerate data distribution. A typical scenario is traffic surges during peak periods, with business value being a 15-20% increase in conversion rates and reduced operational costs."
