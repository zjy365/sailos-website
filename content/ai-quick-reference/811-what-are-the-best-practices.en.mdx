API protection is a critical practice to ensure that Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in cloud-native environments are protected from unauthorized access and data breaches, with its importance lying in safeguarding the security of microservices and containerized applications; application scenarios include inter-service communication in Kubernetes clusters.

Core components include identity authentication (such as OAuth 2.0), fine-grained authorization, transport encryption (mTLS), and audit logs; in practical applications, API gateways and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) filter malicious traffic, and service meshes (such as Istio) implement a zero-trust architecture to enhance overall security.

Implementation steps: First, deploy strong identity authentication (such as JWT); second, enable end-to-end encryption and API rate limiting; third, perform threat detection through gateway monitoring and log analysis; business value lies in reducing attack risks and ensuring compliance (such as GDPR).
