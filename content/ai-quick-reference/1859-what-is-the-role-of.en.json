  "content": "Distributed tracing is a technology used to monitor and diagnose the execution path of requests across multiple microservices. In cloud-native environments, with the rapid increase in the number of services, its importance lies in solving the problem of locating performance bottlenecks in complex chains, and it is typically applied to performance analysis and troubleshooting in microservice architectures.\n\nIts core components include Trace (complete request chain), Span (individual service operation), and context propagation mechanism. It connects cross-service calls through unique IDs and records the time consumption and metadata of each link. This significantly enhances system observability, enabling developers to visualize service dependencies, accurately identify the root causes of delays, and correlate logs with metrics to achieve efficient root cause analysis.\n\nBy real-time presentation of request flows, this technology significantly accelerates performance optimization and fault recovery: 1) Precisely locating slow queries or faulty services; 2) Evaluating the performance impact of new versions; 3) Optimizing unreasonable call chains; 4) Supporting capacity planning. Ultimately, it improves application stability and reduces operational costs, serving as a core pillar of the cloud-native observability system."
