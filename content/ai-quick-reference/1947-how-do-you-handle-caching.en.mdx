The caching strategy for cloud-native applications refers to a mechanism for temporarily storing data to improve performance. It is crucial in containerized and Kubernetes environments, as it can reduce latency, lower database load, and support high-concurrency scenarios such as real-time analytics and microservice communication. Its importance stems from optimizing resource utilization and scaling application responsiveness.

The core of this strategy includes distributed caching systems (such as Redis or Memcached), features like TTL (Time-to-Live) and invalidation handling mechanisms, and principles that rely on consistency and fault-tolerant design (such as preventing cache penetration). In practical applications, cache proxies are implemented through Kubernetes' sidecar pattern or service meshes (such as Istio) to enhance observability and data sharing among microservices, thereby improving overall system resilience and efficiency.

Processing steps: First, evaluate requirements to select tools (such as Redis deployment); second, design the cache layer (such as API gateway integration); third, implement strategies (configure TTL and LRU algorithms); finally, monitor metrics (such as hit rate) and optimize. This delivers business value, such as reducing response time by over 50%, supporting elastic scaling, and saving cloud costs.
