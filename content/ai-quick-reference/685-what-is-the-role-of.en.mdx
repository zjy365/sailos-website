Data replication refers to the process of synchronously creating multiple copies of data in a distributed system, which is crucial for cloud-native applications as it ensures high availability (HA) and enables applications to continue running in the event of failures or disasters. Application scenarios include databases, storage services, and multi-region deployments managed by Kubernetes, preventing downtime caused by single points of failure.

Core components include synchronous or asynchronous replication mechanisms, consistency protocols (such as Raft or Paxos), and automatic failover capabilities. In practical applications, it supports data redundancy and load balancing, for example, implementing cross-node replication in distributed databases. This directly enhances application resilience and reliability, positively impacting business continuity and user experience.

In terms of ensuring high availability, the role of data replication is to enable the system to seamlessly switch to standby replicas when the primary replica fails, maintaining uninterrupted services. Its core values include significantly reducing downtime, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities, and optimizing business resilience to meet SLA requirements.
