  "content": "Microservices architecture is a design style that splits an application into independent, loosely coupled small services. Its importance lies in enhancing system scalability, agility, and support for technical heterogeneity, making it suitable for cloud-native environments and large-scale distributed systems such as e-commerce platforms and real-time data analysis applications.\n\nThe core components include service autonomy, independent deployment, lightweight communication (such as REST or message queues), and dedicated data storage for each service. In terms of characteristics, it supports elastic scaling, fault tolerance, and continuous delivery, promotes DevOps culture, and influences maintainability in the IT field, for example, enabling efficient CI/CD processes and rapid iteration in the microservices ecosystem.\n\nCommon architectural patterns include API Gateway (unified routing and authentication), Circuit Breaker (preventing fault propagation), Service Discovery (dynamic instance location), Saga (distributed transaction management), Event-Driven (asynchronous communication), and Backend for Frontend (client-customized APIs). These patterns enhance system reliability, maintainability, and business responsiveness, and are suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as financial transactions or online services."
