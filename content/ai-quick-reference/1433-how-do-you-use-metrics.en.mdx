In a cloud-native environment, metrics refer to quantifiable data on application performance, such as latency, throughput, and error rates. Their importance lies in enabling real-time observability, supporting auto-scaling, and facilitating rapid failure recovery. They are applied in microservices architectures and Kubernetes clusters to ensure high availability and resource efficiency.

Core components include metric collection tools like Prometheus, with key metric types covering CPU usage and response time. The principle involves providing real-time insights through time-series databases and data analysis. In practical applications, metrics drive performance optimization decisions, such as auto-scaling and anomaly diagnosis, enhancing overall system resilience.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate metric collection tools and configure data sources; 2. Define business-critical metrics and alert thresholds; 3. Analyze historical data to identify bottlenecks; 4. Apply optimization measures such as adjusting resource quotas. A typical scenario is auto-scaling events; business values include enhancing user experience, reducing downtime, and lowering operational costs.
