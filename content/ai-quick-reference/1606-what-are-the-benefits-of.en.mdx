Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of defining and managing infrastructure through code automation, which is particularly important in cloud-native environments. It ensures consistent, reliable, and scalable resource deployment in container, Kubernetes, and microservices architectures, and is widely used in CI/CD pipelines and dynamic application scaling scenarios.

The core components of IaC include declarative configuration files (such as Terraform or Ansible), version control, and automation engines. Its features like idempotency ensure the auditability of infrastructure. In practical applications, it can automatically configure Kubernetes clusters, networks, and security policies, improving DevOps efficiency, reducing human errors, and driving agile transformation of cloud-native platforms.

Its benefits include repeatable infrastructure deployment, cost optimization, and enhanced security. Its application value is reflected in accelerating innovation, simplifying disaster recovery, supporting compliance management, and significantly improving business resilience and resource utilization.
