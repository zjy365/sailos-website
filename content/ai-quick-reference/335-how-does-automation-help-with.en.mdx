Automation technology replaces manual operations through scripts and tools, which is crucial for large-scale application deployment. It can handle the complex requirement of deploying hundreds or thousands of instances simultaneously, serving as a fundamental capability for cloud computing and microservices architectures to ensure fast and reliable software delivery.

Its core lies in CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and container orchestration (such as Kubernetes). By standardizing processes to eliminate human errors, it enables strategies like rolling updates and blue-green deployments, and allows dynamic scaling of resources, significantly increasing release frequency, enhancing system stability, and reducing downtime risks.

Implementation requires three key steps: 1. Version control: managing code and application configurations; 2. Automated building and testing: verifying quality through CI tools (e.g., Jenkins); 3. Continuous deployment: using CD tools (e.g., Argo CD) to coordinate automatic releases on platforms like K8s. The business value is reflected in reducing the time-to-market cycle by up to 90%, supporting elastic scaling to handle traffic peaks, and lowering operational complexity.
