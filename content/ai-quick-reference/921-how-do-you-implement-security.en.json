  "content": "Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system focused on collecting, storing, and alerting on time-series data, which is crucial for providing security monitoring in cloud-native applications. Its importance lies in helping detect threats, ensure compliance, and protect applications from attacks in real-time in containerized environments such as Kubernetes. Application scenarios include monitoring security events such as API anomalies and abnormal access logs.\n\nThe core components of Prometheus include a server for data pulling, Exporters for exposing application metrics, and Alertmanager for notification alerts. It features a pull-based model, supports service discovery and multi-language integration, and works by actively fetching metrics from targets and storing them. In practical applications, it can monitor security-related metrics such as login failure rates, enhance security posture through rapid alerts, and enable automated responses in cloud-native environments.\n\nImplementation steps include: deploying security Exporters to collect metrics; configuring alert rules to detect abnormal behavior; enabling TLS encryption for data transmission; and integrating SIEM tools for log analysis. Business value lies in strengthening security protection, reducing attack response time, and supporting compliance auditing. A typical scenario is using the Prometheus Operator in Kubernetes clusters for automated deployment and monitoring of security events."
