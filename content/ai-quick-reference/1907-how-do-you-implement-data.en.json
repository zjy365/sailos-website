  "content": "Implementing data archiving in cloud-native applications is the process of migrating infrequently accessed (cold) data that needs long-term retention from high-performance storage to low-cost storage tiers. It is crucial for controlling costs, meeting compliance requirements, and optimizing resource utilization. It applies to scenarios such as log retention, historical transaction records, backups, and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe core lies in policy-driven and automation. Key steps include defining declarative archiving policies (based on access frequency, time, and business rules), selecting compatible object storage (e.g., S3-compatible), low-performance block/file storage, or dedicated archiving services as the target tier. Use Kubernetes CSI to achieve storage abstraction, schedule automatic migration tasks through Operators or CronJobs, and ensure idempotency of the archiving process and searchable metadata indexing. Strictly guarantee the integrity of archived data, consistency of security policies, and cross-environment portability.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Develop data lifecycle policies; 2. Configure tiered storage backends; 3. Deploy archiving controllers (such as open-source tools or cloud services) and define policy CRDs; 4. Verify archive integrity and accessibility; 5. Establish audit logs and monitoring alerts. The value lies in significantly reducing storage costs, retaining cold data in compliance, freeing up primary storage resources to improve application performance, and reducing operational burden through automation. Archived data must retain necessary API interfaces for compliance audits or low-frequency queries."
