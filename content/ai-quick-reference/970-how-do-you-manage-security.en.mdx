DevSecOps combines development, security, and operations practices, shifting security left in the software development lifecycle to ensure the security of cloud-native applications from build to runtime. Its importance lies in preventing vulnerabilities, enhancing compliance, and improving application resilience. Application scenarios cover cloud-native architectures based on Kubernetes, microservices, and containers to support rapid delivery and elastic scaling.

Core components include automated security toolchains (such as SAST, DAST, container scanning), security-as-code principles, and cultural collaboration, emphasizing continuous feedback and monitoring. In practical applications, security checks are embedded in CI/CD pipelines, such as scanning code repositories and container images, to increase response speed, reduce risks, and drive overall operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: First, shift security tools left to the development phase, such as integrating IDE scanning; second, automate pipeline security checks, including container registry and K8s configuration auditing; finally, cultivate team culture and train on security best practices. A typical scenario is rapid vulnerability remediation, with business value in reducing security incidents and compliance costs.
