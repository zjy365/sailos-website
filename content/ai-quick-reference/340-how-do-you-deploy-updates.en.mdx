Automated deployment update is the process of automatically pushing new software versions to the production environment through tools, aiming to avoid service interruptions. This is crucial in cloud-native architectures, ensuring seamless user experience and high availability, especially suitable for frequently iterated microservices or Web applications, supporting business continuity.

Core strategies include rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases: rolling updates gradually replace old instances; blue-green deployments run new and old versions in parallel through load balancing and switch traffic; canary releases gradually expose new versions only to a small number of users. In practical applications, Kubernetes' Deployment controller automates these strategies, reducing downtime risks and improving reliability.

Implementation steps include: selecting a strategy such as blue-green deployment; automating testing of new versions; using tools like Helm or Argo CD for deployment; gradually migrating traffic; real-time monitoring of performance; and supporting rollbacks. Typical business values include zero-downtime updates, improved user satisfaction and system resilience, and enhanced business competitiveness.
