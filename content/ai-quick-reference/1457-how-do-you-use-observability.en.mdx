Observability is a key practice for predicting and preventing failures by monitoring the internal state of applications, especially in cloud-native environments, where it ensures high application availability and reduces downtime. Application scenarios include real-time health checks for microservices architectures, enhancing business continuity.

Core components include log collection, metrics monitoring, and distributed tracing. Features involve real-time data analysis and contextual understanding, with principles based on large-scale data processing. In practical applications, combining tools like Prometheus and Grafana enables rapid failure root cause diagnosis, significantly improving system reliability and operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: First, deploy an observability stack (such as OpenTelemetry), define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and alert rules; second, integrate AI analysis to predict bottlenecks; finally, automate response workflows (such as triggering self-healing scripts). A typical scenario is production environment monitoring, with business values including reducing Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), ensuring user satisfaction and stable revenue.
