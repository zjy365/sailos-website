  "content": "Cloud-native storage solutions handle PB-level video and multimedia data through distributed architecture and dynamic scalability. Key use cases include streaming platforms, large-scale content libraries, and real-time analytics, which require high throughput, low latency, and unlimited scalability.\n\nThe core adopts object storage (such as S3-compatible storage) as the foundation, combined with Kubernetes CSI drivers to实现 dynamic provisioning of volumes. Features include: 1) Parallel read/write to support high concurrent access; 2) Automated tiered storage (hot data on SSD/cold data on HDD); 3) Built-in CDN integration to optimize content delivery; 4) Declarative API to manage storage lifecycle.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Deploy a distributed object storage cluster (e.g., Ceph/MinIO); 2) Mount storage to Kubernetes Pods via CSI drivers; 3) Configure HPA to auto-scale transcoding and other processing services; 4) Integrate CDN edge nodes to cache popular content. The value lies in reducing storage costs by 30%+ while improving global user access speed."
