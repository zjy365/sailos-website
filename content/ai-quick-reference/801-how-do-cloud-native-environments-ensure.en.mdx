Cloud-native environment is a cloud application architecture based on containers, microservices, and automated management. It is crucial in cloud computing, ensuring data security to prevent leakage and unauthorized access, and is widely used in sensitive industries such as finance and healthcare.

Core security components include identity authentication (e.g., Kubernetes RBAC), data encryption (in transit and at rest), audit logs, network policies, and container security runtimes. These measures protect sensitive data, support compliance standards (e.g., GDPR), reduce non-compliance risks, and enhance system reliability.

Steps to ensure data security: configure access controls to limit user permissions; enable end-to-end encryption to protect data; set network policies to isolate traffic; regularly audit logs to monitor anomalies; integrate security scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities. A typical scenario is e-commerce protecting payment information, with business values including enhancing customer trust, reducing legal risks, and supporting continuous operations.
