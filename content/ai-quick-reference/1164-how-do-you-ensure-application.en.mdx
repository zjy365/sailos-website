Cloud environment interoperability refers to the ability to achieve seamless collaboration, migration, and operation of applications across multiple cloud platforms. It is crucial for avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing business resilience, and supporting disaster recovery scenarios, especially in industries with high availability requirements such as finance and e-commerce.

Key features include infrastructure abstraction through containerization (e.g., Docker) and container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), as well as API standardization and service meshes to ensure consistent communication. Cloud-native architecture drives cross-cloud deployment, simplifying management and enhancing portability.

Implementation steps: 1. Containerize applications to isolate environmental dependencies; 2. Deploy Kubernetes clusters across multi-cloud platforms for unified orchestration; 3. Utilize API gateways and service meshes to implement service discovery and security control; 4. Develop and test API consistency policies. Business values include cost reduction and improved elastic scalability. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud disaster recovery and application migration.
