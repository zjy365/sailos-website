  "content": "Microservice applications achieve agile development and deployment by decomposing monolithic applications into independent, scalable service components. Failover strategies automatically switch traffic to healthy backups when a service instance fails, ensuring high system availability. They are suitable for cloud-native environments such as e-commerce or financial platforms, reducing downtime losses.\n\nCore components include load balancers (e.g., Nginx), service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Consul or Kubernetes Services), and health check probes. The principle is based on continuous monitoring of service status; when a probe fails, the load balancer redirects requests. In practical applications, Kubernetes automatically restarts failed replicas through Deployment controllers and ReplicaSets, or integrates service meshes like Istio to implement fine-grained traffic management, significantly improving system fault tolerance and business continuity.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy multiple replica service instances; configure health checks (liveness/readiness probes); use load balancing strategies (e.g., round-robin) to route traffic; set up automatic failure detection rules (e.g., based on response thresholds). Typical scenarios include zero-downtime deployments (e.g., blue-green deployment). Business values are reflected in enhancing user trust, reducing maintenance costs, and supporting disaster recovery."
