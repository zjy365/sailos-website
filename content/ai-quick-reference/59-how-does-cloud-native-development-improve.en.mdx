Cloud-native development leverages cloud infrastructure to build scalable applications, enabling agile delivery through containerization and microservices architecture. This approach improves resource utilization efficiency and is suitable for cross-functional team collaboration scenarios, such as independent microservice development and rapid iteration, thereby reducing conflicts caused by environmental differences.

Its core includes microservice decomposition, containerized packaging, and CI/CD automation processes. Microservices allow teams to independently develop specific modules, containers ensure environmental consistency, and CI/CD automated testing and deployment reduce manual intervention. This promotes loosely coupled collaboration, where teams can work in parallel and interact through standard APIs, significantly improving parallel development efficiency and fault isolation capabilities.

Implementation steps include: 1) Splitting microservices by business domain and assigning dedicated teams; 2) Establishing container image repositories and unified CI/CD pipelines; 3) Managing communication through service meshes. A typical scenario is multi-team simultaneous function updates, with business value体现为缩短交付周期50%以上，提升创新响应速度和产品质量.
