  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure resources through code to enable automated deployment; self-healing infrastructure can automatically repair when faults are detected, ensuring high system availability. This combination enhances the reliability and operational efficiency of cloud-native environments, widely used in large-scale cloud deployments and container orchestration, reducing downtime and optimizing resource utilization.\n\nCore components include IaC tools (such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation) for defining declarative configurations, monitoring systems (such as Prometheus) for real-time anomaly detection, and automated response mechanisms (such as Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities) to trigger preset remediation measures. It is characterized by configuration drift identification and rule-driven automatic recovery, applied in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to enhance resilience and reduce human errors.\n\nImplementation steps: First, use IaC tools to write resource definition scripts; second, integrate monitoring and alerting systems to set thresholds; then deploy automated responses (such as scripts or Kubernetes controllers) to automatically execute repair operations. A typical scenario is Kubernetes clusters for cloud-native applications, with business values including improved system availability, reduced operational costs, and ensured compliance."
