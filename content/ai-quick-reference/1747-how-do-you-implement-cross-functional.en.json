  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines infrastructure configurations as version-controlled code files, which is a key practice in cloud-native environments. It is particularly important in cross-functional team collaboration scenarios, such as when Development (Dev), Operations (Ops), and Security (Sec) jointly participate in cloud resource lifecycle management, ensuring consistency, auditability, and accelerating delivery.\n\nThe core elements for achieving collaboration include: 1. Standardized processes: Adopting consistent Git branching strategies (such as Gitflow) and merge request workflows; 2. Toolchain integration: Implementing plan/application automation, state locking, and pipeline approval through Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, Atlantis, or CI/CD platforms (such as GitLab CI); 3. Policy as Code: Integrating OPA/Sentinel into the pipeline to automatically enforce security, compliance, and cost policies; 4. Environment and modularization: Isolating environments with workspaces and creating shared module libraries to promote reuse; 5. Transparency and communication: Using MR as a collaboration node to clarify responsibilities.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Develop specifications: Clearly define code structure, naming conventions, and review processes; 2. Establish version control processes: Enforce code reviews and branch protection; 3. Integrate automated pipelines: Deploy tools to automatically execute plans, generate previews, and block unauthorized changes; 4. Create module libraries: Encapsulate common patterns to reduce duplication; 5. Regular synchronization: Review processes through regular meetings. This practice significantly improves deployment speed, reduces the risk of configuration drift, and enhances security and compliance."
