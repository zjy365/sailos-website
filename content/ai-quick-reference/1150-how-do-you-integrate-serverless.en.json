  "content": "In cloud computing environments, multi-cloud refers to the use of multiple cloud service providers to avoid vendor lock-in, enhance resilience, and optimize costs. Serverless computing (such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) allows developers to deploy code without managing the underlying server infrastructure and pay based on actual usage. Integrating the two is crucial for building fault-tolerant, high-performance, and cross-regional modern applications, especially suitable for cross-cloud data pipelines, global microservices, and bursty load scenarios.\n\nThe core of implementing a multi-cloud serverless architecture lies in abstraction and standardization: adopting a cross-cloud API gateway for unified entry; utilizing message queues (such as Kafka or cloud provider-hosted MQ) to achieve event-driven communication; using tools like Terraform or Crossplane for cross-cloud orchestration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC); and implementing function portability through open-source frameworks like OpenFunction or Knative. The key is to design cloud-agnostic function logic and establish unified security policies (such as identity federation).\n\nThe implementation steps are: 1) Design an event-based cross-cloud application architecture; 2) Select and configure consistent FaaS services (or adopt open-source solutions) for different clouds; 3) Use IaC tools to uniformly deploy and manage functions and associated resources (storage, API gateway); 4) Centralize integration of identity access management and auditing; 5) Deploy a unified monitoring and logging platform. This solution significantly reduces vendor dependency risks, improves business continuity, and optimizes resource costs and innovation speed."
