Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows automated management of infrastructure resources through code. Its importance lies in enhancing consistency, repeatability, and efficiency in cloud-native environments. Application scenarios include deploying message queues like Kafka for asynchronous communication in microservices.

The core components include IaC tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, which define message queue resources like topics and partitions through declarative configuration files to achieve automatic configuration. The principle is to ensure reliability based on version control, and the practical impact is supporting elastic scaling and fault tolerance, applied to event-driven architectures of cloud-native applications.

Implementation steps are: select an IaC tool; write configuration files to define queue parameters; integrate CI/CD for automated deployment. Typical scenarios include containerized messaging, and business values include accelerating delivery, reducing human errors, and enhancing system resilience.
