Continuous Delivery (CD) is a practice that ensures software code can be safely deployed to the production environment at any time, reducing manual operations and improving release efficiency and reliability. It is crucial in cloud-native environments, supporting agile development and rapid iteration, and is suitable for scenarios such as microservices and Kubernetes applications.

The core of CD includes automated testing, deployment pipelines, and feedback mechanisms, building reliable processes through continuous integration tools like Jenkins. Automated deployment enables one-click releases, blue-green deployments, etc., reducing human errors and accelerating issue resolution. Its impact is reflected in improving team productivity, shortening time-to-market, and enhancing customer responsiveness.

Its role in automated deployment is to reliably execute code pushes, version management, and rollback mechanisms to achieve high-frequency releases. The value includes reducing operational risks, optimizing resource utilization, driving business agility, and supporting innovation and competitive advantages.
