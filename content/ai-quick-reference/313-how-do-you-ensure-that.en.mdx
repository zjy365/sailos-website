Container orchestration such as Kubernetes is used to automate the management of the container lifecycle, ensuring resource optimization and reliable deployment. In automated processes, it standardizes container relationships, reduces human errors, and its application scenarios include microservice deployment and CI/CD pipelines.

Core components include orchestration controllers (e.g., Kubernetes Deployment), service discovery, and load balancing. Features include declarative configuration, automatic scaling, and self-healing mechanisms. In practical applications, it supports high-availability clusters, enables lossless deployment through rolling updates, and improves system consistency.

Implementation steps: 1. Define Kubernetes YAML descriptors to specify the desired state. 2. Integrate CI/CD tools to automate releases. 3. Set up health probes to monitor container status. 4. Adopt a blue-green deployment strategy for phased validation. The business value is to improve deployment efficiency, enhance system resilience, and achieve zero-downtime updates.
