Service dependencies in CI/CD workflows refer to the interdependent relationships between services, such as the sequential dependencies between components when deploying microservices. Their importance lies in ensuring the orderly progress of the build, test, and deployment processes to avoid failures; they are applied in containerized and cloud-native environments to enhance delivery reliability.

The core components include dependency management tools (such as workflow configurations in Jenkinsfile or GitHub Actions), and features like sequential triggering and error rollback mechanisms. The principle is based on an event-driven model, and in practice, downstream services are automatically triggered through the CI/CD platform. The impacts include improving team collaboration efficiency and reducing integration bottlenecks.

Implementation steps: 1. Draw a service dependency graph; 2. Configure sequential execution rules in the CI/CD pipeline; 3. Integrate a dependency testing environment; 4. Monitor and verify after deployment. A typical scenario is dependency checking before blue-green deployment; the business value is shortening the release cycle by 20%, reducing failure rates, and improving delivery quality.
