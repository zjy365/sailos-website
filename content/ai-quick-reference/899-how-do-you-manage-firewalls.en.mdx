In cloud-native environments, firewall management ensures dynamic network security between container services and microservices. Its importance lies in providing fine-grained access control, isolating tenant data, and meeting compliance requirements, applied to sensitive service communications in Kubernetes clusters and hybrid cloud deployments.

Core components include Kubernetes NetworkPolicy, which defines Pod traffic rules; service mesh tools (such as Istio) implement policy-based traffic interception. Features include identity-aware policies and automated configuration, which in practical applications enhance security resilience, simplify cloud-native operations, and support the integration of zero-trust network architecture.

Implementation steps: First, design NetworkPolicy files to define inbound/outbound rules; second, deploy a service mesh control platform to monitor traffic; finally, integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate policy updates. Typical scenarios include multi-tenant application isolation. Business values include reducing the risk of data breaches, accelerating compliance audits, and promoting DevSecOps practices.
