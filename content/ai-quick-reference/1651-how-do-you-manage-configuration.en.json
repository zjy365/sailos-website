  "content": "In the IaC workflow, configuration drift refers to the deviation of the actual state of infrastructure from the desired state declared in the code. It undermines system consistency, security compliance, reliability, and reproducibility, and is a core challenge in IaC practices. Effective management is key to ensuring the advantages of declarative infrastructure management.\n\nThe core of management is based on continuous detection and consistency remediation. Use IaC tools (such as Terraform Plan, Ansible --check) or dedicated drift detection tools (such as CloudQuery, driftctl) to regularly scan and report differences. Enforce the \"\"immutable infrastructure\"\" principle: manual changes are prohibited, and the only way to fix drift is to update the code and redeploy through an automated pipeline. Integrating testing and planning phases into the CI/CD pipeline is a key control point.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Automate continuous drift detection (e.g., daily scans); 2. Integrate detection into the CI process, where drift triggers failure; 3. Fix drift only by updating IaC code and triggering a complete, automated consistent deployment (Apply); 4. Promote the GitOps model, where all changes are reviewed and applied through code. This significantly improves audit compliance and reduces failure rates."
