  "content": "Legacy systems refer to long-running traditional IT infrastructures, while multi-cloud infrastructures adopt multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure). Integrating the two can expand system elasticity, reduce costs, and is applied in enterprise digital transformation and hybrid cloud deployment scenarios.\n\nCore components include API gateways, containerized adapters, and message queues, ensuring data interoperability and security. In practice, service deployment is achieved through container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, enhancing system resilience, optimizing resource utilization, and promoting innovative collaboration.\n\nImplementation steps: Evaluate legacy system compatibility, select integration tools (such as Istio), use APIs to bridge data flows, test, and monitor performance. A typical scenario is a financial enterprise migrating an on-premises ERP to a multi-cloud platform, with business values including reduced operational costs, improved availability, and accelerated business agility."
