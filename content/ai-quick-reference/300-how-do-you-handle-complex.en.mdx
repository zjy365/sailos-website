Automated deployment automatically executes the application deployment process through scripts or tools, where handling complex network configurations such as subnet division and firewall rules is crucial to ensure system security, reliability, and efficient connectivity. It is widely used in cloud-native and Kubernetes environments to enhance consistency and scalability.

Core methods include adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC), using tools like Terraform or Kubernetes Network Policies to define network components, enabling version control and repeatable deployment. In practical applications, it is integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automatically manage VPCs, routes, and load balancers, significantly reducing human errors, improving DevOps efficiency, and accelerating the deployment of microservice environments.

The key steps of the processing method are: first, defining network configurations using IaC languages; second, automatically applying and updating them in the deployment pipeline; finally, performing network verification tests. A typical scenario is AWS VPC firewall setup, and the business value lies in ensuring fast and secure deployment, reducing maintenance costs, and improving system resilience.
