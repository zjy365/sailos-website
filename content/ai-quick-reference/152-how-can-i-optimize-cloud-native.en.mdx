Low-latency applications require instant responses, commonly used in financial transactions, real-time gaming, and the Internet of Things to ensure user experience and system reliability. Optimizing cloud-native development environments enhances performance through cloud-native technologies, supporting distributed deployment and efficient resource utilization.

The core includes efficient container scheduling, network optimization, and lightweight resource management. Leveraging Kubernetes features such as node affinity scheduling and Istio service mesh reduces network latency; application scenarios involve microservice orchestration, which can significantly reduce response time to milliseconds and increase throughput.

Implementation steps: First, build lightweight container images to reduce startup time; second, configure Kubernetes node affinity rules to deploy Pods close to data sources; finally, optimize network stacks such as eBPF acceleration. Typical scenarios include high-frequency trading systems, and the business value lies in improving user response speed and operational efficiency while reducing the risk of failures.
