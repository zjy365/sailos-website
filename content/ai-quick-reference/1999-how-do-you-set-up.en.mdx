Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system used to collect and store time-series metrics data; Grafana is a visualization platform that transforms data into dashboards. As cloud-native monitoring tools, they are crucial for ensuring the high reliability and performance of containerized applications (such as Kubernetes clusters) and are applied in scenarios like real-time fault detection, resource optimization, and compliance monitoring.

The core of Prometheus includes service discovery mechanisms and the PromQL query language. It pulls metrics based on a Pull model and supports multi-dimensional data labels and alerting rules. Grafana provides flexible visualization plugins and dashboard customization. In practical applications, Prometheus collects node and application metrics (such as CPU and memory) and implements alerting by integrating Alertmanager; Grafana is used for centralized display, enhancing system observability and accelerating problem diagnosis.

Implementation steps include: first, deploying Prometheus Operator in the Kubernetes cluster, configuring target discovery and data retention policies; then installing Grafana and adding Prometheus as a data source; finally, creating dashboards and customizing charts to monitor key metrics such as request latency. The business value lies in automating operations and maintenance, shortening fault response time, optimizing resource utilization, and driving efficient operation and maintenance processes.
