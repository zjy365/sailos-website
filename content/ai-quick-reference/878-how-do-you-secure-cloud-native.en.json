  "content": "Protecting cloud-native applications on hybrid clouds involves ensuring the security of containerized applications deployed in both public and private cloud environments to address cross-environment threats and meet compliance requirements. The importance lies in preventing data breaches and business disruptions, with application scenarios including sensitive industries such as finance and healthcare.\n\nCore components include identity and access management (RBAC authorization), network security (service meshes like Istio for microservice isolation), and data encryption (transport layer TLS and storage encryption). Features are based on the zero-trust principle, requiring continuous monitoring and verification, with practical impacts including enhancing overall security posture and reducing the risk of lateral attacks.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy fine-grained identity authentication; configure service meshes to control network traffic; enable end-to-end data encryption; integrate continuous monitoring and logging tools; perform regular audits. Business values include enhanced compliance and minimized downtime."
