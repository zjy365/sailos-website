A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer in cloud-native architectures that manages communication between services, enhancing security, observability, and control by abstracting network logic. It is crucial in microservices environments, addressing security challenges in distributed systems, and is widely used in containerized platforms like Kubernetes to ensure compliant and highly available communication.

The core of a service mesh includes sidecar proxies (such as Envoy) in the data plane and policy management tools (such as Istio) in the control plane, featuring enforced TLS encryption, identity-based service authentication, and granular access control policies. This supports a zero-trust security model, which in practical applications automatically intercepts attacks, reduces man-in-the-middle risks, simplifies security operations, and enhances the overall resilience and compliance of cloud-native applications.

Its benefits include automated end-to-end encryption to ensure data privacy, reduced vulnerability risks caused by configuration errors, and enhanced threat detection through traffic monitoring. The business value is reflected in reducing the cost of security incidents, supporting DevSecOps integration, meeting regulatory compliance such as GDPR, and improving organizational security posture and efficiency.
