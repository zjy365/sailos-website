The integrity of cloud-native data storage refers to the correctness and consistency of data in a distributed environment, preventing corruption or unauthorized modification. Its importance lies in ensuring business continuity, data reliability, and compliance (such as GDPR). Application scenarios include microservice architectures, Serverless applications, and persistent storage (e.g., Kubernetes persistent volumes), supporting transaction processing and backup recovery.

Core components include storage system built-in mechanisms (such as checksums and replica synchronization), monitoring tools (such as Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for visualization), and cloud-native frameworks (such as Kubernetes CSI drivers). The principle is based on regular data scanning, hash algorithm verification, and real-time alert mechanisms. In practical applications, automated tools are used to detect anomalies (such as disk errors), improving system availability and reducing operational costs, with impacts extending to enhanced security auditing and SLA compliance.

Implementation steps: First, deploy integrated monitoring solutions such as using Kubernetes Operators or cloud services (AWS CloudWatch); second, configure verification rules, alert thresholds, and log integration (such as ELK Stack); third, run regular integrity tests. A typical scenario is database backup verification, with business values including reducing the risk of data loss, optimizing Recovery Time Objectives (RTO), and supporting regulatory compliance.
