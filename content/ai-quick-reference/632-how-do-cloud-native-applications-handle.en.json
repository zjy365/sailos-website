  "content": "Cloud-native applications process real-time data streams through containerization and microservices architecture, leveraging the elasticity and automation features of cloud platforms. Real-time data processing is crucial for time-sensitive scenarios such as financial transaction monitoring, IoT device data analysis, and real-time recommendation systems, ensuring low latency and high responsiveness. Core components include stream processing engines like Apache Kafka or Flink, deployed as containers in Kubernetes clusters to enable automatic resource scheduling and fault tolerance mechanisms. Features include elastic scaling, continuous integration and delivery, and event-driven architecture. In practical applications, cloud-native real-time processing supports dynamic inventory updates or user behavior analysis, significantly optimizing decision efficiency and reducing latency. Implementation steps include deploying stream processing microservices as container instances, configuring horizontal autoscaling via Kubernetes to handle load fluctuations, and integrating Prometheus monitoring to optimize performance. Typical scenarios such as real-time log analysis or security threat detection deliver business value such as improved user experience and accelerated market response."
