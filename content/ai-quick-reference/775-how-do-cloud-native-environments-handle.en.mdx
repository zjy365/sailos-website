Cloud-native environments manage the data storage of game applications through container orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes), providing elastic scaling and high availability. The key is to support player status, assets, and real-time data synchronization, suitable for multiplayer games and globally distributed scenarios, ensuring low-latency and high-performance requirements.

Core components include Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), StorageClasses, and utilize cloud-native databases (such as CockroachDB) or object storage (such as S3). Features involve the principle of state separation, supporting dynamic resource allocation and data redundancy. Practical applications include player data persistence, leaderboard updates, and disaster recovery, improving data reliability and operational efficiency.

Implementation steps include: 1. Configure StorageClass to define storage policies. 2. Create PVC to dynamically bind resources. 3. Deploy StatefulSet to manage the database cluster. Business values are achieving data consistency, supporting large-scale concurrency, reducing costs, and optimizing player experience, such as reducing interruptions and enabling rapid scaling.
