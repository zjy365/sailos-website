Hybrid cloud-native application architecture integrates private and public cloud resources to deploy and manage applications using cloud-native technologies. Its value lies in balancing data sovereignty requirements with elastic scaling capabilities, making it suitable for scenarios that need to balance compliance and business agility, such as the collaborative deployment of core financial transaction systems and marketing systems. This architecture has become a critical path for modern enterprises' digital transformation.

The core of implementation lies in building containerized applications and a cross-cloud Kubernetes orchestration layer. Key components include: 1) Container orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes Federation or OpenShift) to enable cross-cluster scheduling; 2) Service meshes (such as Istio) to handle cross-cloud service communication and security policies; 3) Declarative CI/CD pipelines to ensure deployment consistency; 4) Unified monitoring and logging systems. The infrastructure layer needs to implement hybrid resource pooling management through API abstraction.

Implementation is carried out in four steps: First, evaluate the sensitivity of business modules and define the deployment boundaries between private clouds (for core data) and public clouds (for elastic services). Second, select a cross-cloud Kubernetes management solution (such as Anthos/AKS-HCI), and configure network peering connections and load balancing. Third, transform applications into a microservice architecture and design cross-cloud failover mechanisms. Finally, establish hybrid DevOps processes with integrated security scanning and compliance checks. After implementation, resource utilization can be increased by 30%, and fault recovery time can be reduced to the minute level.
