  "content": "Cloud-native applications are based on containerization and microservice architectures, utilizing asynchronous data processing for background tasks to enhance system performance, reliability, and scalability. They are applied in event-driven scenarios such as real-time analytics, batch jobs, and high-concurrency services to ensure non-blocking operations.\n\nCore components include message queues (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ), event brokers (e.g., Cloud Pub/Sub), and Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda). Features include service decoupling, fault-tolerant retries, and horizontal scaling, with the principle of implementing asynchronous workflows through event distribution. Practical impacts include optimized resource utilization, support for financial payment processing or IoT data streams, and enhanced overall system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: Integrate message middleware, design event producer and consumer services, and implement monitoring and rollback mechanisms. Business value lies in reducing costs, minimizing latency, and supporting elastic scaling. Typical scenarios include asynchronous notification systems or log batch processing, improving processing throughput."
