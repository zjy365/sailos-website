  "content": "Protecting sensitive data across multiple cloud environments involves unified security policies across different cloud platforms. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and meeting compliance requirements (such as GDPR), especially widely used in hybrid clouds and industries like finance. The core is to ensure that data is controlled whether in storage or transmission.\n\nProtection measures include: encrypting static data using cloud provider or customer-managed keys (AES-256); protecting dynamic data via TLS/SSL; replacing sensitive fields with tokenization; centralized key management (e.g., HSM); strict RBAC and least privilege access control. These measures collectively implement a zero-trust architecture and support business continuity.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Identify and classify sensitive data; 2) Select tools that support cross-cloud encryption (e.g., Key Vault); 3) Deploy unified access policies and audit logs; 4) Use CASB or SPM tools to monitor data flows; 5) Conduct regular penetration testing and policy optimization. Ultimately, this reduces the risk of cross-platform data exposure and builds a unified protection surface."
