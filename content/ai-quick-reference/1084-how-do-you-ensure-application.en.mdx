A hybrid cloud environment integrates public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises resources. Ensuring application availability is key to maintaining business continuity and meeting compliance requirements, making it suitable for scenarios requiring elastic scaling and sensitive data processing such as finance or healthcare.

Core strategies include cross-cloud redundant deployment, automatic load balancing, and failover mechanisms. Tools like Kubernetes enable container orchestration, supporting seamless scaling and self-healing, enhancing system resilience, and optimizing resource distribution to address cross-cloud failures.

Implementation steps: 1) Design a multi-availability zone architecture; 2) Integrate load balancers; 3) Enable automatic failure recovery; 4) Deploy real-time monitoring systems. Business value: Minimize downtime risks, ensure user experience and SLA compliance, and drive business growth.
