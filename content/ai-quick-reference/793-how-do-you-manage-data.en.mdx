In cloud-native applications, managing data integrity and availability ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and always accessible in distributed environments such as Kubernetes clusters, preventing loss or disruption. This is crucial because microservice architectures often encounter node failures or inconsistency issues, with application scenarios covering e-commerce and financial systems.

The core includes persistent volumes (such as Persistent Volumes) providing storage redundancy, StatefulSets managing stateful services, and replication mechanisms (such as database sharding) achieving high availability. Through snapshot backups, consistency models, and cloud databases (such as Amazon RDS), practical applications enhance system resilience, reduce downtime, and support elastic scaling.

Implementation steps: prefer persistent storage solutions; configure automatic backups and replication (such as Kubernetes CronJobs); enable monitoring and alerts. A typical scenario is real-time data processing applications. Business values include zero data loss, continuity of user access, and compliance assurance.
