Hybrid cloud authentication refers to the process of centrally managing authentication and authorization for users accessing resources across multiple cloud service providers. Its core purpose is to address the issue of permission fragmentation, ensuring consistency, security, and compliance in cross-cloud access, and it is commonly used in multi-cloud architectures and migration scenarios.

The key lies in establishing identity federation using standard protocols (such as SAML 2.0, OIDC), designating the enterprise IdP (e.g., Azure AD, Okta) as the single source of truth, and establishing trust relationships with various cloud platforms (AWS IAM Identity Center, Azure Entra ID, GCP Workload Identity Federation). Core components include: 1) Identity Provider (IdP); 2) Service Provider Proxy (SP Proxy); 3) Centralized Policy Engine. Through federated identity, users can securely access different cloud resources with single sign-on, eliminating the need for multiple sets of credentials, while supporting fine-grained RBAC and auditing.

Implementation steps: 1) Configure cloud service providers as relying parties in the enterprise IdP; 2) Enable identity federation on each cloud platform, configure trust, and map IdP attributes to local roles; 3) Set up unified access policies in the IdP or cloud platforms; 4) Enable centralized log collection (e.g., SIEM) to audit cross-cloud activities. The business value lies in unifying security baselines, reducing operational overhead, and meeting compliance audit requirements.
