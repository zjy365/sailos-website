  "content": "Disaster Recovery (DR) ensures that cloud-native applications can recover quickly from disasters such as regional failures to maintain business continuity and meet SLAs. Its application scenarios include high availability requirements for critical microservice deployments.\n\nThe core components include data redundancy, automatic failover, and multi-region deployment. It features an elastic architecture, implemented through Kubernetes cross-cluster synchronization or cloud platform redundancy. In practical applications, it reduces downtime, improves system resilience, and significantly impacts the reliability of fields such as financial services.\n\nImplementation steps: assess risks; configure cross-cloud region clusters; integrate backup tools such as Velero; set up automatic switching logic; conduct regular disaster drills. A typical scenario is multi-cloud architecture deployment. Business values include minimizing downtime losses, ensuring compliance, and optimizing costs."
