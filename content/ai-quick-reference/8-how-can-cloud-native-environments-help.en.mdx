Cloud-native environments are built on cloud infrastructure using technologies such as containerization, microservices, and continuous delivery. Their importance lies in enhancing the agility and reliability of DevOps processes, supporting rapid iteration through automation; they are mainly applied to the development of distributed systems on cloud platforms, such as the efficient management of microservice architectures.

Core components include container engines (e.g., Docker), orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), microservice decomposition, and automated CI/CD pipelines. Features include declarative configuration, self-healing capabilities, and elastic scaling. In practical applications, it reduces manual deployment bottlenecks through a unified platform, promotes collaboration between development and operations teams, and significantly accelerates deployment frequency and simplifies failure recovery.

Implementation steps include containerizing applications, deploying Kubernetes clusters for automated orchestration, and integrating CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins or GitLab) to enable continuous testing and release. Typical scenarios include rapid release of updates on the cloud; business value is reflected in shortening time-to-market, optimizing resource utilization, and reducing operational costs.
