  "content": "Multi-cloud infrastructure refers to resources deployed across multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). Integrating monitoring tools is crucial, providing unified observability to ensure system reliability, performance optimization, and cost control, and is widely used in enterprise-level distributed environments.\n\nCore components include data collectors, central dashboards, and API gateways, characterized by scalability and cross-platform support. The principle is to aggregate metrics through tools (such as Prometheus or Grafana), and in practical applications, alert automation is implemented to improve operational efficiency and reduce downtime impact.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Assess requirements and select a platform (such as Datadog). 2. Deploy agents to each cloud environment. 3. Configure data sources and unified views. 4. Test alert mechanisms. Typical scenarios are used for large-scale application deployment, and business values include reducing operational risks, improving user experience, and optimizing resource utilization."
