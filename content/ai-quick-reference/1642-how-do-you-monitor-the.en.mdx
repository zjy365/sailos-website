Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines infrastructure configurations programmatically. Performance monitoring ensures the efficient and reliable operation of deployed resources, preventing configuration drift and resource waste. It is crucial in cloud-native environments, supporting automated deployment, compliance auditing, and cost optimization, such as Kubernetes cluster management.

Core components include monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus for metric collection) and alert systems, characterized by automation and real-time observation of resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory). In practical applications, it is integrated into CI/CD pipelines to enable performance bottleneck detection and root cause analysis of failures under microservice architectures, enhancing system observability and operational response efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Embed monitoring agents in IaC templates. 2. Automate the deployment of monitoring configurations via CI/CD tools. 3. Set metric thresholds and alert rules. 4. Analyze data using visualization dashboards (e.g., Grafana). Business values include reducing downtime risks, optimizing cloud resource costs, ensuring business continuity, and improving user experience.
