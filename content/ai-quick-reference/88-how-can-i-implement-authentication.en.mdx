In a cloud-native environment, authentication verifies entity identities, and authorization determines access permissions to ensure the security of distributed systems. Its importance lies in preventing unauthorized access, such as in API exposure and inter-microservice communication scenarios, while ensuring multi-tenant compliance and data privacy.

The core components include: authentication integrating identity providers using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, and authorization defining roles and permissions based on RBAC or ABAC policies. In practical applications, Kubernetes service accounts implement service authentication, and service meshes like Istio enhance authorization control, significantly improving system reliability and audit capabilities.

Implementation steps: 1) Deploy an OIDC provider (e.g., Keycloak); 2) Configure Kubernetes RBAC rules to map user roles; 3) Apply policies at the service layer. Typical scenarios include API gateways filtering requests, bringing business value such as reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and meeting regulatory requirements.
