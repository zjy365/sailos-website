  "content": "Cloud-native applications achieve environmental consistency through technologies such as containerization to handle cross-platform compatibility and portability. Cross-platform compatibility ensures that applications run seamlessly across multiple cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) or on-premises environments, while portability facilitates code migration and reduces the risk of vendor lock-in. This is crucial in highly flexible multi-cloud deployments, hybrid cloud migrations, and global business expansion.\n\nThe core lies in containerization (e.g., Docker) encapsulating applications and dependencies to provide a standard runtime environment. Orchestration tools like Kubernetes manage cross-platform clusters, declarative configurations (such as YAML files) define resource requirements, and infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g., Terraform) automate deployments. These ensure environmental abstraction, support microservices architecture, simplify multi-cloud management, facilitate continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines, and reduce operational complexity.\n\nProcessing steps: isolate applications using containers, deploy to Kubernetes clusters, and write platform-agnostic configurations. A typical scenario is migrating applications to a hybrid cloud environment. Business values include cost reduction, accelerated iterative innovation, and enhanced application reliability and scalability."
