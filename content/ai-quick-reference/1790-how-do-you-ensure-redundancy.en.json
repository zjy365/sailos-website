  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the deployment of cloud infrastructure using code to ensure consistency; redundancy and high availability reduce downtime by eliminating single points of failure, enhancing business continuity, which is crucial in scenarios such as e-commerce or financial services.\n\nThe core lies in configuring multi-region/availability zone resources, load balancers, and auto-scaling groups, with health checks and failover mechanisms defined through IaC tools. Practical applications include Terraform deploying AWS Auto Scaling to eliminate single points of failure, thereby enhancing system resilience and reducing risks.\n\nImplementation steps: Design multi-region deployment; integrate load balancers to route traffic; set up auto-scaling to handle peaks; enable monitoring and alerting. Business values include 24/7 service availability, improved customer experience, and avoidance of revenue loss, typical for high-traffic cloud applications."
