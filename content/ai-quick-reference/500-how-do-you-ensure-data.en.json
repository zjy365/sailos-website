  "content": "In a microservices architecture, microservice communication refers to data interaction between services; data integrity ensures that data is accurate, reliable, and free from tampering or loss during transmission and processing. Its importance lies in maintaining system consistency and reliability, especially in distributed environments such as financial transactions, healthcare, and other sensitive application scenarios.\n\nThe core components include transport layer encryption (e.g., TLS), message signing, transaction rollback mechanisms, and idempotent operations. The principle is to ensure data security based on digital certificates and verification; practical applications such as message queues (Kafka) ensure asynchronous and ordered delivery, and API gateways integrate authentication to enhance robustness, significantly impacting the fault tolerance and compliance of cloud-native systems.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy end-to-end encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL). 2. Use message queues to manage retries and persistence. 3. Design idempotent APIs to avoid duplicate operations. 4. Implement compensation transactions to handle failures. A typical scenario is the e-commerce order flow; business values include reducing error risks, enhancing customer trust, and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR."
