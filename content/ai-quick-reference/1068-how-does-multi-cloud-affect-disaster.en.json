  "content": "Multi-cloud refers to a distributed infrastructure that utilizes multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). It enhances the reliability of disaster recovery and business continuity, reduces the risk of single cloud failures, and is suitable for critical sectors like finance and healthcare that require high availability and compliance.\n\nThe core includes cross-cloud data synchronization, automatic failover, and load balancing mechanisms. Through geographical redundancy and elastic resource allocation, system resilience is improved; practical applications such as real-time service switching significantly reduce downtime, meet strict recovery objectives (RTO/RPO), and optimize overall IT resilience.\n\nThis strategy avoids vendor lock-in and provides a cost-effective disaster recovery solution; its business value lies in strengthening global coverage, reducing operational risks, ensuring service continuity, thereby enhancing customer trust and business competitiveness."
