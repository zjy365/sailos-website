  "content": "Monitoring tools are used to track application dependencies and interactions to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure system reliability. Their importance lies in enhancing observability, facilitating fault diagnosis and optimization, and they are commonly used in microservice architectures and cloud-native environments, such as reducing service disruptions.\n\nThe core includes distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger), log aggregation (ELK Stack), and service maps, which provide an end-to-end view by capturing request flows and dependency calls in real time. Application tools like Prometheus or Datadog enable visual interaction monitoring between microservices, thereby enhancing system stability, reducing fault recovery time, and having a direct positive impact on SLA achievement.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1. Selecting APM tools such as New Relic or Zipkin; 2. Integrating tracing SDKs into applications; 3. Configuring log and metric collection; 4. Using dashboards to analyze dependencies. Typical scenarios include Pod communication monitoring in Kubernetes, and business value is reflected in quickly locating issues, optimizing resource allocation, and reducing operational costs."
