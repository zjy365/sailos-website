Observability data, including logs, metrics, and traces, enables the monitoring and diagnosis of internal system behaviors. In cloud computing and Kubernetes environments, its importance lies in early anomaly detection and reducing downtime risks; application scenarios include troubleshooting, performance optimization, and service quality assurance.

Core components encompass alerting rules (such as threshold triggering or ML-based anomaly detection) and incident response mechanisms (such as automated workflows). Through features like dynamic priority assignment and integrated tools (Prometheus, Grafana), practical applications can reduce MTTR, enhance system reliability, and support SLO compliance.

Implementation steps: 1. Standardize data collection and aggregation; 2. Define alert rules and set priorities; 3. Integrate response tools (e.g., automated runbooks); 4. Continuously test and optimize strategies. Typical business values include minimizing incident impacts, improving user experience, and reducing operational costs.
