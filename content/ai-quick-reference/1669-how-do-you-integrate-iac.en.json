  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) uses code to automatically manage basic resources (such as servers or networks), and integration with containerization tools like Docker enables standardized deployment of container environments. Its importance lies in improving automation levels, ensuring consistency and repeatability, with application scenarios including DevOps processes, cloud-native application deployment, and hybrid cloud environment management.\n\nThe core components include IaC tools (e.g., Terraform) that define the infrastructure state, characterized by version control and declarative configuration; the principle is to create Docker hosts (such as virtual machines) and execute container commands during deployment through scripts. In practical applications, integration can automate container lifecycle management, promote efficient resource utilization, and support collaboration with Kubernetes.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define container hosts in IaC files (for example, configure virtual machines using Terraform). 2. Add Docker installation scripts or integrate orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes). Business values include simplifying scaling, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities, and reducing human errors."
