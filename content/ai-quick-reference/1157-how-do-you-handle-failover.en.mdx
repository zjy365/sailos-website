In multi-cloud deployment, failover refers to the automatic switching of traffic and services to the backup systems of other available cloud providers when one cloud environment fails, in order to maintain business continuity. Its importance lies in improving high availability and resilience, and avoiding vendor lock-in risks. It is commonly used in downtime-sensitive fields such as finance and e-commerce to ensure uninterrupted services.

The core of failover includes service meshes (such as Istio), multi-cloud load balancers, and health monitoring tools. Its features involve cross-cloud health check mechanisms that can detect failures in real-time and trigger routing switches. In practical applications, automated mechanisms achieve seamless transition through global traffic management, such as using cross-cloud ingress controllers, which have a significant impact on cloud-native architecture, enhancing fault tolerance and reducing downtime risks.

Implementation steps include: deploying a unified monitoring system to detect failures in real-time; configuring automatic failover policies for Kubernetes or similar platforms, such as triggering actions through Prometheus and Alertmanager; scheduling traffic to backup resources; and regularly testing policies to ensure effectiveness. The typical business value lies in maximizing availability, reducing data loss, and supporting agile scaling.
