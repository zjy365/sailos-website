Container security is crucial in cloud-native environments to protect applications from threats, as the dynamic nature of containerized applications and microservice architectures are vulnerable to exploits. Its application scenarios include Kubernetes cluster deployments and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring data integrity and compliance, and preventing security incidents such as data breaches.

Core components include container image scanning (to detect vulnerabilities), runtime protection (to monitor abnormal behavior), network isolation policies (to restrict access), and identity authentication mechanisms. Based on the principle of least privilege, tools like Clair or Falco are integrated into development processes in practical applications, which enhances the resilience and trustworthiness of the cloud-native ecosystem and reduces the attack surface.

Implementation steps: First, scan container images for vulnerabilities during the build phase; second, configure Kubernetes security policies such as Pod Security Admission control; finally, deploy runtime monitoring and automatic response tools. A typical scenario is integrating security testing into CI/CD, with business values including reducing compliance risks, ensuring service continuity, and optimizing operational efficiency.
