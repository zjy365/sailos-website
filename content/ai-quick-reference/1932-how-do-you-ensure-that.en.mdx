Security development practices for cloud-native applications refer to the process of embedding security controls into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which is particularly crucial in containerized and Kubernetes environments. It ensures that applications meet security compliance standards from design to deployment, enhancing application resilience and attack protection capabilities. Its core application scenarios include DevSecOps pipelines, which can reduce vulnerability risks in cloud environments.

The core components include: Infrastructure as Code scanning (e.g., Terraform), container image vulnerability analysis, dependency security testing, and Policy as Code implementation. The features are automated security testing, continuous monitoring, and the ""Shift-Left Security"" principle. Embedding security toolchains (such as Trivy, OPA) into the DevOps process to achieve automation and standardization of security controls. The practical impact is to promote collaboration between development and security teams, identify and fix vulnerabilities at an early stage, and significantly reduce risks in the production environment.

Implementation steps include: integrating automated scanning tools in CI/CD; performing static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) security testing; configuring runtime security policies (e.g., network policies); establishing continuous monitoring and log auditing mechanisms. Business values include reducing the vulnerability exposure window, improving compliance, supporting agile and secure application releases, and directly reducing incident costs and reputation risks.
