  "content": "Ensuring the security of microservice communication in Kubernetes is crucial, which involves preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access, safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission. It is the core of cloud-native application security, especially indispensable in multi-tenant and sensitive data processing scenarios.\n\nCore security mechanisms include: 1) Service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd): providing transparent mTLS (mutual TLS) to automatically encrypt inter-service traffic and verify identities; 2) Network Policies: precisely controlling network traffic between Pods (e.g., only allowing communication with services in specific namespaces or with specific labels); 3) Service Accounts and RBAC: cooperating with the Kubernetes API Server to implement service identity authentication and fine-grained authorization; 4) Secrets management: securely storing and distributing sensitive credentials such as TLS certificates and tokens.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Dividing services into namespaces; 2) Enabling and configuring default-deny network policies; 3) Deploying a service mesh to automatically inject Sidecars and enforce mTLS; 4) Binding service accounts with least-privilege RBAC rules; 5) Securely managing certificates through Vault or Sealed Secrets. This significantly reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, enhances the zero-trust architecture, and meets compliance audit requirements."
