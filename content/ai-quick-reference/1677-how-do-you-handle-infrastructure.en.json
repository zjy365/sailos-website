  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is a core concept for automating infrastructure management through code, ensuring configuration version control and repeatable deployment. Its importance lies in improving deployment efficiency, reducing human errors, and supporting rapid iteration in agile environments. Application scenarios include cloud-native systems such as Kubernetes cluster management, which is particularly suitable for multi-team collaboration in handling infrastructure changes, such as development environment configuration and resource scaling.\n\nCore components include template files (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation scripts), version control systems (e.g., Git), and modular design. Features involve declarative configuration, automated testing, and audit tracking. In practical applications, IaC allows teams to independently modify modular components, share code through a central repository, avoid conflicts, and enhance cross-team standardization. It has a positive impact on DevOps processes, such as improving reliability and resource utilization, and enabling one-click deployment.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Establish a modular IaC repository to support team isolation of changes; 2. Adopt a branching strategy, such as feature branches for development and main branches for production environments; 3. Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, ensuring changes comply with standards; 4. Define roles and approval processes to manage permissions. Typical scenarios, such as multi-team sharing of cloud resources, have business values including reducing deployment risks, accelerating release cycles, and improving team autonomy efficiency."
