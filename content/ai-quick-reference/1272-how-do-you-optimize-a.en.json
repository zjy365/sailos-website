  "content": "CI/CD pipeline is an automated software delivery process used to build, test, and deploy applications when code changes occur. Its importance lies in significantly shortening the release cycle and reducing the risk of human errors, making it suitable for cloud-native development and DevOps environments to achieve efficient iteration and reliability.\n\nThe core includes source code management integration, parallel test execution, containerized builds, and environment deployment orchestration. Through features such as automated feedback mechanisms and blue-green deployment, it increases release frequency and quality, enhances team productivity, and has an impact such as reducing downtime in microservice architectures.\n\nOptimization steps: 1. Optimization of testing strategies, such as running unit tests in parallel to accelerate feedback. 2. Caching dependencies in the build process to reduce time. 3. Simplifying the deployment process by adopting a canary release strategy. The business value is reducing deployment time to minutes, increasing time-to-market, and improving customer satisfaction."
