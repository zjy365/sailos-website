  "content": "Hybrid cloud security control refers to the unified management of security measures, such as data protection and access control, in multi-cloud (public and private cloud) environments. Its importance lies in ensuring data compliance across cloud environments and preventing data leakage, with application scenarios including enterprise resource integration and meeting regulatory requirements.\n\nThe core includes Identity and Access Management (IAM), encryption, network segmentation, and real-time monitoring, ensuring consistency through unified policy tools (such as Cloud Access Security Brokers). Practical applications involve automated threat detection and log auditing, significantly enhancing resilience, reducing non-compliance risks in hybrid deployments, and accelerating response times.\n\nImplementation steps: Evaluate the existing environment and define unified policies; integrate IAM tools such as single sign-on; deploy end-to-end encryption; enable monitoring platforms; perform regular security audits and automated responses to improve business continuity."
