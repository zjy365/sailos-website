  "content": "In cloud-native applications, session persistence means that user requests are always processed by the same service instance to ensure state continuity; stateful services such as databases store persistent data. Its importance lies in providing a consistent user experience and high availability, applied to state-sensitive scenarios such as e-commerce and finance.\n\nCore components include Kubernetes StatefulSets to manage service identities and deployment order, Persistent Volumes (PV) to store data, and service meshes to handle traffic routing. Features include network stability, storage binding, and seamless scaling. Practical applications include Redis caching or message queue systems, improving fault tolerance and reducing the risk of data loss.\n\nManagement steps: 1. Deploy stateful applications using StatefulSets. 2. Integrate PV/PVC to store data. 3. Configure load balancers to achieve session persistence based on cookies/IP. Typical scenarios include online session management, with business values of enhancing reliability, supporting elastic scaling, and optimizing user experience."
