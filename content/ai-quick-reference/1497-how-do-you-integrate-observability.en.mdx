Observability is the ability to monitor system behavior (logs, metrics, traces) to diagnose issues, while Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tools manage the process of applications from development to deployment. Integrating the two is crucial for improving DevOps efficiency, enabling rapid fault identification, optimizing release cycles, and is applicable to scenarios such as continuous delivery and environmental monitoring.

Core components include observability pillars (such as Prometheus for metrics collection) and ALM tools (such as Jenkins for pipelines). Data synchronization is achieved through API integration, and monitoring feedback is automatically triggered during the deployment phase, providing real-time application health insights, thereby reducing downtime and improving team response speed and iterative quality.

Implementation steps: First, configure the integration of observability tools (such as OpenTelemetry) with ALM platforms (such as GitLab CI), and set up automated alerts and data pipelines; second, add performance verification steps in the CI/CD process, such as pre-deployment testing; typical scenarios include canary release monitoring, and business value is reflected in improving application reliability and reducing costs.
