  "content": "In a multi-cloud environment, cloud-native application compliance management ensures that containerized applications across multiple cloud platforms adhere to regulatory requirements such as GDPR or CIS. This is crucial as it avoids fines, enhances data security, and supports continuous operation in highly regulated industries.\n\nCore components include Kubernetes policy engines (e.g., Open Policy Agent), unified auditing tools (e.g., Falco), and policy-as-code frameworks. Features involve automated policy enforcement, real-time monitoring, and centralized governance. In practical applications, this achieves seamless compliance through multi-cloud management platforms (e.g., Anthos), improving cross-cloud consistency and reducing human errors.\n\nImplementation steps are: first, define compliance policies; second, integrate into CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment; finally, monitor and report non-compliance incidents. Typical scenarios include automatic detection of cloud configuration deviations. Business values include risk reduction, improved audit efficiency, and ensuring global compliance."
