The CI/CD pipeline is an automated software delivery process that combines Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), aiming to quickly and securely release code changes to the production environment. It is crucial in DevOps and cloud-native applications, used to accelerate release cycles, improve software quality, and support frequent updates in cloud computing environments.

Core components include source code management integration, automated build tools, testing frameworks (such as unit and integration testing), and deployment mechanisms. Features include pipelined steps (trigger, build, test, deploy), ensuring repeatability and real-time feedback, and reducing human errors. In practical applications, it promotes team collaboration, reduces defect rates, and enables seamless rolling updates in container platforms like Kubernetes, significantly improving software delivery efficiency.

By automating execution steps (code commits trigger the pipeline, automatic building and testing, deployment after verification), CI/CD pipelines eliminate manual deployment tasks. Typical scenarios include hotfixes and feature releases for cloud applications, bringing business value such as reducing time-to-market by 50%-80%, improving reliability, and lowering operational costs.
