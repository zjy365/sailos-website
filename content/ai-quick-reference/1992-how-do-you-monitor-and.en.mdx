In cloud-native environments, microservices are small, independently deployed application components. Monitoring and protecting them is crucial to ensure system reliability and security. This importance stems from the dynamic and distributed nature of cloud-native, with application scenarios including real-time transaction systems such as e-commerce and finance, which need to handle elastic scaling and fault isolation.

The core components of monitoring include log aggregation, metric collection, and distributed tracing, characterized by real-time visualization and automated alerts; protection involves service meshes (e.g., Istio) implementing authentication, authorization, and API encryption. Practical applications ensure rapid fault response (such as detection of latency surges) and compliance, with impacts including improved service resilience and reduced risk of security vulnerabilities.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy tools like Prometheus for monitoring metrics and integrate Grafana for visualization; 2. Set up zero-trust policies through service meshes (e.g., Istio), including API gateway protection; 3. Automate vulnerability scanning and apply policies. Typical scenarios include anomaly detection and intrusion prevention, with business values covering reduced downtime losses and enhanced data protection, compliant with industry standards such as GDPR.
