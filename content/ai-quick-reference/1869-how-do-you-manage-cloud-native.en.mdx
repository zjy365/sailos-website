The security of cloud-native applications at the network layer focuses on protecting communication between microservices and data transmission. This is crucial because cloud-native architectures rely on microservices and containerization, making them vulnerable to network attacks such as sniffing or unauthorized access. Its application scenarios include Kubernetes clusters and service mesh environments, ensuring multi-tenant isolation and data confidentiality, and supporting the zero-trust security model.

The core components include network policies (such as Kubernetes Network Policies defining traffic rules), service meshes (such as Istio implementing mTLS encryption and service authentication), and API gateways controlling inbound traffic. Features involve micro-segmentation, identity-based dynamic authorization, and observable logs. In practical applications, these tools automate policy enforcement, isolate namespaces, reduce the attack surface, impact the overall resilience of the cloud-native ecosystem, and accelerate compliant deployments.

Implementation steps: 1. Design a zero-trust architecture and define policies; 2. Deploy tools such as Istio or Calico to configure network policies; 3. Enable mTLS encryption for inter-service communication; 4. Continuously monitor logs and conduct audits. Business values include reducing the risk of data breaches, improving system availability, supporting agile development, and complying with regulations such as GDPR.
