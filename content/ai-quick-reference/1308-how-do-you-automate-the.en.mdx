CI/CD pipeline is a process in software development that automates the building, testing, and deployment of code. Integrating cloud resource management automation can accelerate delivery, reduce human errors, and support efficient operation and maintenance of cloud-native applications in DevOps environments, suitable for scenarios such as dynamically scaling cloud infrastructure.

The core includes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation) and automation scripts, combined with CI/CD platforms (such as Jenkins or GitLab CI). Its principle is to define resources as version-controllable code, execute deployment, testing, and rollback in the pipeline, and achieve consistent and replicable cloud environment management, thereby improving resource utilization and agility.

Implementation steps: 1. Define IaC configuration files in the code repository; 2. Integrate CI/CD tools to trigger resource changes; 3. Automate testing to verify configurations; 4. Deploy and monitor cloud resources. A typical scenario is automatically scaling Kubernetes clusters, and the business value includes shortening the release cycle and reducing operating costs by 10%-20%.
