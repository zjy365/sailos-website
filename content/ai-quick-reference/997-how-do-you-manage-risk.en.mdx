Cloud-native environment risk assessment refers to the process of identifying, analyzing, and managing security threats arising from the adoption of container, microservice, and dynamic orchestration (such as Kubernetes) architectures. It is crucial because the dynamic and distributed nature of cloud-native environments amplifies risks such as misconfigurations, image vulnerabilities, and compliance deviations, requiring保障 throughout the entire application lifecycle to ensure business resilience.

Core components include: real-time asset inventory (containers, Pods, service discovery), configuration baseline verification (e.g., CIS Kubernetes standards), image vulnerability scanning (CI/CD integration), runtime threat detection (network policies, abnormal behaviors), compliance auditing (e.g., GDPR/HIPAA mapping), and least privilege (RBAC, Pod security policies). Automation tools (e.g., OPA, Falco, Trivy) are key to achieving continuous monitoring.

Implementation steps: 1. Inventory all cloud-native assets (clusters, namespaces, workloads); 2. Develop security baselines and automate checks (Infra-as-Code); 3. Integrate image scanning into CI/CD pipelines to block high-risk deployments; 4. Deploy runtime protection and network micro-segmentation; 5. Establish continuous compliance auditing and incident response processes. The business value lies in reducing the risk of data breaches and service disruptions, and accelerating secure and compliant delivery.
