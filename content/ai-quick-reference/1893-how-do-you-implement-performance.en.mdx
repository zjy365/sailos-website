Cloud-native applications are based on containerization and microservice architectures, and performance testing evaluates their responsiveness and reliability under load. Its importance lies in ensuring service availability in dynamic cloud environments, applied to high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce platforms or streaming services.

The core includes container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), distributed components, and automation tools. Features involve high scalability and microservice dependency chains, with the principle based on load generators simulating user traffic. Practical applications test API latency and resource bottlenecks, with impacts including optimizing infrastructure costs and enhancing fault recovery capabilities.

Implementation steps include: defining test objectives (e.g., number of concurrent users); selecting tools such as JMeter or Prometheus; developing test scripts to simulate real traffic; executing tests in a pre-production environment; monitoring metrics like response time; analyzing results to optimize the application. Typical scenarios include traffic peak simulation, and the business value is improving scalability and user experience.
