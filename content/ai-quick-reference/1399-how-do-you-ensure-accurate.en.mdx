Rollback refers to the process in a CI/CD pipeline of restoring an application to a previously stable version. Restoration ensures the system quickly returns to a healthy state, reducing downtime and maintaining service continuity. It is crucial in handling errors, bugs, and other scenarios during production deployments, supporting efficient delivery and business continuity.

Core components include version control to track changes, immutable artifact management such as Docker images, automated testing to ensure stability, and rollback strategies like blue-green deployment or canary release. Tools like Kubernetes' deployment rollback feature enable automated execution to reduce human errors. In practical applications, it enhances system resilience and prevents fault propagation, with impacts including accelerated iteration and improved reliability.

Implementation steps: 1. Store all code and artifact versions in a repository; 2. Define and automate rollback strategies; 3. Integrate monitoring and alerting to trigger restoration; 4. Regularly test the rollback process. Typical scenarios include operations when a new version fails; business values are reducing risks, ensuring high availability, and optimizing recovery efficiency.
