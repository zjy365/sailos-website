  "content": "Managing security vulnerabilities in cloud-native environments involves continuously identifying, assessing, and remediating weaknesses in applications, which is crucial for ensuring data privacy, service reliability, and compliance (such as GDPR). Application scenarios include protecting containerized services (e.g., Kubernetes pods) to prevent data breaches and ransomware attacks.\n\nCore components include static scanning tools (e.g., Trivy), runtime monitoring (e.g., Falco), and policy enforcement (e.g., OPA). Features include automated integration, multi-layered defense, and real-time response mechanisms. In practical applications, this reduces the attack surface, accelerates security incident handling, and enhances the resilience of the overall cloud-native architecture.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Embed scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect image vulnerabilities; 2) Configure security policies (e.g., PodSecurityPolicy); 3) Monitor runtime behavior and respond to anomalies; 4) Conduct regular audits and remediations. Business values include reducing operational risks, ensuring business continuity, and enhancing user trust."
