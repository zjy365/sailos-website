  "content": "Configuration management is responsible for managing application settings and environment variables in automated deployment, ensuring consistency and reliability. Its importance lies in eliminating manual errors and accelerating the deployment cycle, with wide application in cloud-native scenarios within continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) processes, such as containerized deployment in Kubernetes clusters.\n\nCore components include tools like Ansible or Kubernetes ConfigMaps, which are used for externalized configuration storage and environment separation. Features include version control, automated synchronization, and secure secret management. In practical applications, by distinguishing between development/production environment configurations and integrating them into CI/CD pipelines, deployment success rates are significantly improved and rapid iteration across multiple environments is supported.\n\nProcessing steps include: first, separating code from configuration and managing it using dedicated tools; second, integrating into automated deployment scripts such as Terraform or Jenkins pipelines; and finally, adopting security mechanisms like Hashicorp Vault to protect sensitive data. Typical scenarios involve seamless switching of environment configurations, and business value is reflected in reducing human risk, improving agility, and lowering operational costs."
