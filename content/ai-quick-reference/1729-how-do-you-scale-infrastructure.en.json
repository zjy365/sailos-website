  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) defines and manages infrastructure through executable configuration files, enabling automated deployment. Cross-cloud region expansion is crucial as it enhances application high availability, disaster recovery capabilities, and meets compliance requirements such as data residency, making it suitable for business scenarios requiring global coverage.\n\nThe core of implementing cross-region deployment lies in the modularization and parameterization capabilities of IaC tools (such as Terraform, AWS CDK). Key features include: using variables (e.g., `region`) to abstract configuration details specific to a region; creating reusable modules to encapsulate common infrastructure components (e.g., VPC, computing clusters); and instantiating these modules by providing different regional variable values. This ensures consistent and rapid replication of infrastructure across target regions, significantly improving elastic scaling efficiency and simplifying large-scale multi-cloud management.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Parameterize regional configurations: Define regions as input variables in IaC code; 2) Modular design: Encapsulate reusable resources into modules; 3) Environment definition: Create specific variable files or workspaces for different regions; 4) Automation process: Utilize CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to automatically execute deployments to designated regions based on input parameters/events. Business values include accelerating global deployment speed, ensuring environmental consistency, reducing the risk of human errors, and enhancing business continuity."
