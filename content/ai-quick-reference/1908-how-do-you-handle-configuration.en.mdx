Cloud-native configuration management involves externalizing application configurations to be independent of the code environment, thereby enhancing application portability and scalability. It is crucial in dynamic cloud environments, supporting efficient deployment, elastic scaling, and environmental consistency of microservice architectures, while reducing deployment conflicts.

Core components include configuration storage such as Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secrets, dynamic injection mechanisms, and version control tools. It is characterized by the principle of immutable infrastructure, supporting automatic refresh and secure encryption. In practical applications, it enables zero-downtime switching across multiple environments and automates disaster recovery, significantly reducing operational costs.

Processing steps: Define configurations using a declarative API, implement change tracking and auditing with GitOps, and automate deployment updates through CI/CD pipelines. The business value lies in improving application reliability, accelerating release cycles, and reducing errors.
