  "content": "Cloud-native data storage refers to distributed databases based on containerized platforms, such as Cassandra, which possess elasticity and high availability features. External API integration involves connecting third-party service interfaces to achieve data interaction. This integration is crucial for building dynamic applications, supports real-time business analysis, and is applied in IoT data processing and hybrid cloud environments.\n\nCore components include API gateways like Kong or Envoy for handling routing, service meshes such as Istio for managing communication security, and event-driven architectures for achieving loose coupling. Features include scalability and security authentication such as OAuth. The principle utilizes HTTP or gRPC protocols to facilitate data flow. In practical applications, integration accelerates data analysis services, for example, in Kubernetes, combined with Prometheus to monitor system performance.\n\nImplementation steps: Define integration requirements and data flow models. Deploy an API gateway to proxy external API calls, configure a service mesh to manage internal communication. Add authentication mechanisms and test endpoint performance. Typical scenarios include real-time data synchronization such as inventory management. Business values include reducing development costs, improving application response speed, and optimizing user experience."
