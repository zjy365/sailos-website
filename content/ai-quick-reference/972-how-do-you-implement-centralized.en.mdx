Cloud-native environments, based on containers and microservices, offer flexibility and scalability but introduce dynamic attack surfaces and compliance risks. Centralized security management unifies security policies, monitoring, and response to ensure consistent protection across multiple clusters and microservices. Its importance lies in simplifying the protection of complex environments, with application scenarios including financial services and e-commerce platforms to address regulatory requirements and reduce data breaches.

Core components include policy as code, role-based access control (RBAC), network isolation, and unified log aggregation tools (such as Prometheus). Features emphasize automated execution and centralized visualization, and in practice, real-time threat detection is achieved through integration with service meshes (such as Istio) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems. Application can improve compliance rates and reduce operational costs, affecting industry standards such as the implementation of zero-trust architecture.

Implementation steps: Define policy baselines; deploy policy engines such as OPA; configure RBAC and network policies; integrate centralized logging and monitoring tools (such as the ELK stack); automate scanning and updates. Typical scenarios cover development and production environments, with business values including improving security posture, reducing maintenance overhead, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
