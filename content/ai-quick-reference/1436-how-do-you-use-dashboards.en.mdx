Dashboard visualization is a tool that displays performance data of cloud-native applications through a graphical interface. It is crucial for real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis, and resource optimization in distributed environments such as Kubernetes clusters, supporting efficient operation and maintenance as well as business continuity.

Core components include performance metrics collectors (such as Prometheus to collect CPU, memory, etc.), data storage (such as time-series database TimescaleDB), and visualization platforms (such as Grafana), with features including real-time updates and custom charts. In practical applications, by integrating these components, microservice response times and error rates can be monitored, improving the efficiency of SRE practices and reducing the risk of system downtime.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy monitoring toolchains (such as Prometheus and Grafana). 2. Configure applications to expose performance metrics. 3. Build Grafana dashboard custom views (such as latency heatmaps or resource utilization meters). Business values include accelerating problem localization, optimizing cloud resource costs, enhancing user experience, and improving development agility.
