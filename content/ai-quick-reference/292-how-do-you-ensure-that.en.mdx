The repeatability of automated deployment refers to the ability to consistently execute deployments in various environments such as development, testing, and production. It is crucial as it ensures environment consistency, reduces configuration drift and deployment failures, and accelerates software releases. Application scenarios include continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and multi-cloud strategies.

Core components include Infrastructure as Code (IaC) such as Terraform for defining environments, containerization such as Docker for isolating dependencies, configuration management tools such as Ansible, and version control such as Git. The principle is based on declarative configuration and environment isolation to ensure that each deployment can be reproduced. In practical applications, this improves CI/CD reliability, reduces manual errors, supports agile development, lowers costs, and enhances system maintainability.

Implementation steps: 1. Define environment configurations using IaC; 2. Containerize applications; 3. Automate testing and building; 4. Version control changes; 5. Isolate environments. This brings business value such as faster release cycles, reduced operational risks, improved team collaboration efficiency, and ensured cross-environment consistency.
