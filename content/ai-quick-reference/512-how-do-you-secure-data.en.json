  "content": "Microservice data transmission security refers to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of communication between services. It is crucial in a microservice architecture to prevent data leakage, tampering, and attacks. It is applicable to cloud-native scenarios such as Kubernetes environments to ensure business continuity.\n\nThe core includes mutual TLS (mTLS) for authentication and encrypted transmission, and authorization mechanisms that enforce access control through service meshes (e.g., Istio) to ensure end-to-end security. In practice, it enhances the resilience of microservice systems and supports compliance requirements.\n\nImplementation steps: Configure the service mesh to enable mTLS; deploy an API gateway to manage access policies; use HTTPS to encrypt data; integrate key management tools. A typical scenario is a Kubernetes cluster, which brings the value of reducing risks and accelerating compliance."
