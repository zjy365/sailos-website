  "content": "Hybrid cloud integrates public cloud, private cloud, and on-premises infrastructure to provide a flexible computing environment. Its importance lies in enabling enterprises to comply with strict industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring data sovereignty and security. Application scenarios include healthcare and financial services, which require sensitive data to be stored in specific regions and processed in a controllable manner.\n\nCore components include resource pooling, unified management, and security controls such as encryption and access policies. Features include data isolation (with sensitive data stored in private clouds), scalability, and audit trail mechanisms. In practical applications, hybrid cloud deploys critical workloads such as payment processing in compliant regions, reducing risks and simplifying compliance impacts with industry frameworks like PCI DSS.\n\nImplementation steps: Assess regulatory requirements; design a hybrid architecture, locating sensitive data in private clouds or on-premises; deploy security controls such as monitoring and encryption. A typical scenario is keeping electronic health records on-premises while conducting analysis in the public cloud. Business values include cost optimization, accelerated compliance certification, and maintenance of customer trust."
