In a monolithic architecture, data is centrally stored in a single database, each module shares the data schema, and data consistency is ensured through database transactions. The microservices architecture emphasizes that each service has its own dedicated database (i.e., the ""database per service"" pattern), with data managed分散ly and decoupled through service boundaries. This difference affects system design complexity and maintainability.

The core differences are reflected in: 1) Data storage: monolithic uses centralized storage, while microservices use distributed autonomous storage; 2) Transaction processing: monolithic ensures consistency through database ACID transactions, and microservices adopt eventual consistency solutions such as the Saga pattern; 3) Data ownership: services access external data only through APIs, avoiding direct sharing of database schemas; 4) Query mechanism: monolithic supports cross-table SQL queries, and microservices need to be implemented through aggregate APIs or the CQRS pattern.

The practical value of this difference is that microservices achieve independent service deployment and scaling through data autonomy, supporting agile team development. However, it introduces the complexity of distributed data management, and the architecture needs to be selected by weighing business requirements. Typical implementation requires defining service boundaries, implementing an API gateway, and selecting an appropriate database synchronization strategy.
