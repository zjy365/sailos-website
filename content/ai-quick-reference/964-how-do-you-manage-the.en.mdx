In a cloud-native environment, the security of containerized applications involves protecting application code, data, and runtime within microservices and container-based architectures. This is crucial as it prevents data breaches and denial-of-service attacks, ensures business continuity and compliance, and is applied to platforms like Kubernetes in hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.

Core components include container image scanning (such as using Trivy to detect vulnerabilities), runtime monitoring (such as Falco capturing abnormal behavior), network security policies (such as Kubernetes NetworkPolicies restricting traffic), and identity management (such as RBAC controlling permissions). It is characterized by the principles of zero trust and least privilege, with the underlying principle involving tool integration and automation. Practical applications include embedding security scans in CI/CD pipelines, influencing DevSecOps processes, and enhancing the overall security posture of application deployments.

Implementation steps: first, scan container images to fix vulnerabilities; then configure security policies, such as setting up network isolation and access controls; finally, monitor runtime behavior and implement automated compliance checks. Typical scenarios include real-time threat detection in Kubernetes clusters, with business values including reduced risk, accelerated secure releases, and improved regulatory compliance.
