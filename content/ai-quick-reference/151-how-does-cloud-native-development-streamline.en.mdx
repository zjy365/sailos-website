Cloud-native development is based on containerization, microservices, and DevOps practices, emphasizing application portability and elasticity, making it inherently suitable for cloud environments. This approach is crucial in cloud migration; by designing applications to be cloud-agnostic, it significantly reduces platform dependencies and compatibility issues. Application scenarios include the modernization transformation when enterprises migrate from traditional infrastructure to the cloud, enhancing agility and scalability.

Its core features include Kubernetes orchestration management, auto-scaling, and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. These components modularize applications, facilitating batch migration of microservices, reducing overall risks, and accelerating deployment cycles. The practical impact is reflected in minimizing downtime during migration, enhancing security through cloud-native tools like service meshes, and optimizing resource utilization, thereby improving migration efficiency and system reliability.

Specific implementation steps include: first, refactoring monolithic applications into microservice architectures; second, encapsulating applications using container technologies such as Docker; finally, gradually migrating through automation tools (such as Kubernetes clusters or migration services), supplemented by testing and monitoring. This process simplifies migration complexity, and the business value includes significantly reducing costs, shortening time-to-market, and achieving seamless scaling and flexible deployment in hybrid cloud or multi-cloud environments.
