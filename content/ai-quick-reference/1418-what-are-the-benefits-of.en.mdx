Adopting a centralized logging system in a multi-cloud environment enables unified log collection, storage, and analysis across cloud platforms and on-premises infrastructure. Its core value lies in breaking down data silos, providing global operational visibility, ensuring security compliance, and supporting troubleshooting and performance optimization.

The system consists of log collection agents (e.g., Fluentd), central storage (e.g., Elasticsearch/S3), and a visualization layer (e.g., Kibana/Grafana), supporting real-time aggregation, standardization, and multi-dimensional correlation analysis. Key technologies include automatic discovery, dynamic parsing, and retention policy management. It can quickly locate cross-cloud service dependency failures, enable security threat tracking, and drive resource optimization decisions through historical data.

In practical applications, enterprises can significantly reduce the mean time to recovery (MTTR) by 30%-50%, uniformly meet audit requirements such as GDPR, and reduce decentralized storage costs. Deployment steps typically include: configuring lightweight agents on each node, defining unified log pipelines, setting role-based access control (RBAC), and establishing key business indicator alerts. Ultimately, it enhances system resilience and optimizes cloud resource utilization.
