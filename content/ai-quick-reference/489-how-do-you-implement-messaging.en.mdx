In a microservices architecture, message passing and queuing enable decoupled interactions between services through asynchronous communication mechanisms, enhancing system scalability and reliability. They are suitable for event-driven scenarios such as order processing or real-time data analysis.

Its core components include message brokers (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ), characterized by queue persistence, publish/subscribe patterns, and message ordering. The principle is that producers push messages to queues, and consumers pull and process them. Applications include event sourcing and distributed transaction compensation, significantly reducing coupling and enhancing resilience.

Implementation steps: Deploy message brokers and define queue structures; microservices act as producers to publish events, and consumers asynchronously subscribe to process data. Typical scenarios include asynchronous order fulfillment. The business value lies in increasing throughput, reducing the impact of failures, and ensuring the stable operation of distributed systems.
