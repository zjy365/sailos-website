Microservices architecture enhances scalability and flexibility by decomposing monolithic applications into loosely coupled small services. Each microservice is independently developed, deployed, and scaled, focusing on a single business capability. Its importance lies in the ability to quickly respond to changing requirements and technological evolution, making it particularly suitable for scenarios requiring high concurrency, rapid iteration, and complex business logic, such as e-commerce platforms or large-scale online service systems.

The core lies in the independence and autonomy of services: 1) Each service has its own independent deployment unit and data storage, allowing the selection of the most appropriate technology stack; 2) Lightweight communication mechanisms (such as REST, gRPC) enable interaction; 3) Relying on containerization (such as Docker) and orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes) to achieve automated deployment, scaling, and governance. This enables the system to scale granularly: only scaling high-load services (e.g., payment modules) rather than the entire application; meanwhile, the flexibility of the technology stack allows on-demand selection (e.g., using Python for AI services and NoSQL for database services).

Its business value is significant: 1) Elastic scalability: Allocating resources on demand to optimize costs and handle traffic peaks; 2) Agile innovation: Teams can independently iterate services, accelerating feature delivery and technology upgrades; 3) Fault isolation: Abnormalities in a single service do not affect the overall system. Implementation requires establishing continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD), service monitoring, and API gateways, with typical scenarios such as regional deployment of global services. Ultimately, it significantly improves system response speed and resource efficiency.
