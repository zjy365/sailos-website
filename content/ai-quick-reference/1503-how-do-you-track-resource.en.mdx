Tracking resource utilization across multiple cloud platforms involves monitoring the efficiency of computing resources such as CPU and memory usage. This practice is crucial for optimizing costs and avoiding resource waste, and is commonly used in multi-cloud environments to support cost management and sustainable operations. Its application scenarios include enterprise cloud migration and service scaling.

Core tools include cloud-native monitoring services (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor) and third-party platforms (such as Datadog or Grafana), which aggregate multi-platform data through APIs to provide real-time metrics and historical analysis. Features include automated alerts and unified dashboards to help identify idle resources. Practical impacts include optimized resource allocation, reducing cost overhead by 20-30%.

Implementation steps: 1) Configure each cloud API to integrate with a central system; 2) Deploy analysis tools for visualization and alerting; 3) Regularly review and adjust strategies. Business values are significant cost savings, improved operational efficiency, and elastic support. Typical scenarios include resource scheduling in hybrid cloud environments.
