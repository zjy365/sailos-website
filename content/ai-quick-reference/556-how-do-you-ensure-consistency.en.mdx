In a microservices architecture, distributed system consistency refers to the correct synchronization of data states among multiple independent services. Its importance lies in maintaining the integrity of business logic and avoiding transaction conflicts and data errors. Application scenarios include order processing systems, where inventory services and payment services need to collaborate to complete transactions.

The core elements for achieving consistency include the Saga pattern, event sourcing, and compensating transactions. Saga executes a series of local transactions in sequence and combines compensation logic to roll back failed operations; event sourcing records state change events to ensure audit trails. In practical applications, message brokers such as Kafka provide reliable delivery and support eventual consistency models, reducing system coupling but increasing design complexity.

Implementation steps include: 1. Designing a Saga workflow, defining transaction sequences and compensation mechanisms; 2. Adopting idempotent operations to handle duplicate messages; 3. Using an asynchronous event-driven architecture to integrate services. A typical scenario is e-commerce order creation, with business value in improving system reliability and scalability while reducing risks.
