Cloud-native Security Posture Management is the process of systematically monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing the security status of cloud environments. It is crucial for defending against dynamic threats and ensuring compliance, applied in cloud-native platforms such as Kubernetes for containerization and microservices to prevent data breaches and attacks.

Core components include vulnerability scanning (e.g., CVE detection), configuration hardening (e.g., RBAC and network policies), access control, and real-time threat detection. It is characterized by automation and continuous monitoring. In practical applications, tools like Trivy and OPA policy engines are utilized, integrated into CI/CD pipelines to enhance security resilience and response efficiency, thereby reducing security incidents.

Management steps: First, deploy security scanning tools (e.g., Clair) and policy-as-code (e.g., Kyverno) to achieve configuration automation; second, monitor runtime activities and conduct regular risk audits. The business value lies in reducing vulnerability risks, saving costs through compliance checks, and ensuring application continuity.
