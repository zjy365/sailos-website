  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of automating the configuration and management of cloud infrastructure using scripts, ensuring consistency and reliability in deployments. Its importance lies in reducing manual errors, enabling repeatability, and accelerating cloud migration, with wide application in cloud-native environments such as container orchestration and CI/CD workflows.\n\nThe core includes the use of provider-specific tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, combined with version control and testing frameworks. The principle emphasizes defining resources through declarative code to enable automated auditing. The practical impact is enhancing the efficiency of cloud resources and supporting large-scale deployments, such as optimizing Kubernetes cluster management and strengthening security compliance.\n\nDuring implementation, follow these steps: first, adopt the framework recommended by the provider; second, integrate static analysis tools (such as Checkov) for compliance checks; third, conduct regular testing and code reviews; and finally, automate deployment verification. Typical scenarios include cost optimization projects, with business values covering risk reduction and resource efficiency improvement."
