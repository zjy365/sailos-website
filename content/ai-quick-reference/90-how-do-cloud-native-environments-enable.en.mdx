Blue-green deployment is a key cloud-native deployment strategy that achieves zero-downtime updates by maintaining two independent environments in parallel (blue for the current production version and green for the new version). Its importance lies in ensuring service continuity and reducing the risk of release failures, with application scenarios including high-availability business updates in microservice architectures to support seamless user access.

The core components include load balancers for routing traffic and environment isolation design; its characteristics are rapid switching and automatic rollback capabilities, with the principle relying on the instantaneous traffic switching point. In practical applications, Kubernetes controls distribution through Service Selector, with impacts including improving system resilience and facilitating continuous delivery processes.

Implementation steps: 1. Prepare blue-green environments and deploy updates to the green version; 2. Test the new version; 3. Switch traffic to the green version via Ingress or Service; 4. Monitor and roll back if necessary. Typical scenarios involve microservice releases; business values include eliminating downtime, enhancing reliability, and accelerating iteration cycles.
