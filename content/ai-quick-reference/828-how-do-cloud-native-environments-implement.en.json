  "content": "Cloud-native environments automate container lifecycle management through container orchestration, ensuring efficient application operation in cloud environments. Implementing security is crucial to prevent data breaches and attacks, supporting the reliable operation of microservice architectures in sensitive fields such as finance and e-commerce.\n\nCore security measures include Pod Security Policies to define container permissions, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage authentication, network policies to isolate traffic, and container image scanning to detect vulnerabilities. These features are integrated into the Kubernetes platform, promoting \"\"shift-left security\"\" in DevOps practices, where security checks are automatically executed through continuous integration pipelines.\n\nImplementation steps: First, configure RBAC to restrict the permissions of users and services; second, define network policies to control Pod communication; then use image scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities; finally, deploy runtime monitoring tools such as Falco to detect abnormal behavior. This significantly reduces risks, ensures the rapid deployment of secure applications, and improves compliance and business continuity."
