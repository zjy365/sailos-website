IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates the deployment and management of infrastructure using code, ensuring consistency and auditability. Setting up continuous compliance checks involves verifying through automated tools whether the infrastructure meets security standards or regulatory requirements, such as PCI DSS, with each change. Its importance lies in reducing human errors and enhancing security posture. Application scenarios include cloud migration or DevOps pipelines to maintain real-time compliance and support agile development.

Core components include IaC platforms (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation) and compliance engines (e.g., Open Policy Agent or AWS Config), featuring policy as code, version control, and scanning capabilities. In principle, these tools integrate with CI/CD systems to automatically perform policy evaluations during the build or deployment phase. In practical applications, such as in hybrid cloud environments, they automatically detect deviations and generate reports, reducing risks affecting business operations and promoting compliance-driven deployment processes.

Implementation steps: 1. Define compliance policy code (e.g., using Rego language). 2. Integrate IaC tools with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions). 3. Configure automated scanning nodes (pre-commit validation and post-deployment monitoring). 4. Set up alert and reporting mechanisms. A typical scenario is cloud resource compliance monitoring, with business values including ensuring continuous compliance, rapid issue resolution, and optimizing cost efficiency.
