  "content": "In the CI/CD pipeline, multi-service dependency refers to the interdependent relationships between services in a distributed system. Its importance lies in ensuring the correct deployment order, avoiding system interruptions caused by dependency failures, and it is applicable to microservice architectures and cloud-native environments, such as the collaboration of multiple components in e-commerce platforms.\n\nThe core includes defining a dependency graph, configuring the trigger sequence for building and deployment, and using tools like Kubernetes Helm for service discovery. Features cover event-driven mechanisms, health checks, and automated testing to ensure that dependent services are verified before deployment. In practical applications, it improves deployment reliability, reduces human errors, and affects cloud-native efficiency.\n\nManagement steps: Identify dependency relationships; set up sequential triggers in CI tools (such as Jenkins pipelines); integrate monitoring alerts and test failure rollbacks. Typical scenarios include blue-green deployment of microservice modules. The business value lies in accelerating the release cycle, reducing failure rates, and enhancing system resilience and maintainability."
