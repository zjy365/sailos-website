  "content": "In a microservices architecture, inter-service communication involves multiple independent services interacting over a network. Secure communication ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, preventing unauthorized access and data leakage, which is crucial in sensitive application scenarios such as finance and e-commerce.\n\nThe core of implementing security includes mutual TLS (mTLS) for bidirectional authentication and encrypted transmission, API gateways for centralized access control management, and service meshes like Istio that provide proxy-layer security. In practical applications, configuring certificates and policies enforces authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, reducing the attack surface and improving system reliability.\n\nDeployment steps: 1. Integrate service mesh tools (e.g., Istio) and enable automatic mTLS and certificate management. 2. Define fine-grained authorization policies to control service access. 3. Monitor and audit traffic. A typical scenario uses Kubernetes, with business values including enhanced compliance, reduced data risks, and support for agile development."
