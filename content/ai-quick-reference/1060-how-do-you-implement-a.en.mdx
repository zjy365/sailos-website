In a hybrid cloud environment, a centralized logging system uniformly collects, stores, and analyzes log data across private and public clouds, providing a comprehensive monitoring view. Its importance lies in enhancing system observability, supporting fault diagnosis, ensuring compliance auditing, and strengthening security posture. Typical application scenarios include multi-platform operation and maintenance, incident response, and resource optimization.

The core components of the system include log collection agents (such as Fluentd or Fluent Bit), central storage engines (such as Elasticsearch or Loki), and visualization tools (such as Kibana or Grafana). Features include scalability, real-time processing, and protocol support (e.g., Syslog). In practical applications, it realizes log aggregation and intelligent alerting, simplifies hybrid cloud management, significantly reduces operational latency, and improves fault tolerance.

Implementation steps are: 1. Plan the logging scheme (select tool sets and define data flows). 2. Deploy collection agents to all nodes (e.g., Kubernetes clusters or VMs). 3. Configure central storage and secure transmission (e.g., using TLS encryption). 4. Integrate analysis and alerting (set thresholds and dashboards). Business values include saving more than 50% of operation and maintenance costs, accelerating problem response, and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR.
