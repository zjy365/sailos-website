In cloud-native environments, compliant logging and auditing refer to capturing, storing, and reviewing system activity logs to meet regulatory requirements (such as GDPR or HIPAA), ensuring security and accountability tracking. This is crucial for maintaining regulatory compliance, monitoring security threats, and incident response, and is widely applied in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare.

Core components include standardized log formats (e.g., JSON), centralized log management systems (e.g., Fluentd for collection, Elasticsearch for storage), secure transmission (TLS encryption), and access control (e.g., RBAC). Features involve automation, scalability, and real-time capabilities. In practical applications, it detects abnormal behaviors through log analysis and provides audit evidence to satisfy compliance reviews, thereby reducing security risks and improving operational reliability.

Implementation steps: First, define compliance requirements and adopt unified logging standards; second, deploy log collection tools such as Fluentd; third, configure secure storage such as Elasticsearch with access control; finally, implement automated audit reporting and alerting. Typical scenarios include Kubernetes application log management. Business value lies in reducing compliance costs, enhancing system observability, and increasing customer trust.
