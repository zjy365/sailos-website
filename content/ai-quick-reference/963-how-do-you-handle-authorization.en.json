  "content": "Serverless functions are stateless code units executed in a cloud environment without the need to manage infrastructure. Authorization ensures that only authenticated entities can trigger or access functions, preventing unauthorized operations, which is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance. They are applied in scenarios such as API gateways and event-driven automation.\n\nThe core includes cloud services like IAM roles and policies, implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or the principle of least privilege. Features involve policy binding, resource permission definition, and request authentication. The practical impact is reducing the attack surface through API keys, OAuth, or service integration, and optimizing the security of microservice communication.\n\nImplementation steps: Define permission requirements; create IAM roles and assign policies; attach roles to functions; configure API gateway or event source authentication. Typically used in data processing or integration tasks, the business value is enhancing security protection while simplifying operation and maintenance, and improving scalability."
