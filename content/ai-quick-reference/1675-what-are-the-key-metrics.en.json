It is applicable to scenarios such as resource deployment, configuration, and version control.\n\nKey monitoring metrics include configuration drift detection, change success rate, resource health status, and compliance indicators. These metrics track inconsistencies and execution risks in real-time through integrated tools, ensuring the reliability of automated management and reducing operational costs.\n\nApplying these metrics can prevent misconfigurations, enhance compliance auditing and fault recovery capabilities, and optimize business continuity and cost efficiency."
