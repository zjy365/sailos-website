Cloud-native development is an approach to building applications in cloud environments, relying on containerization, orchestration, and microservices technologies to enhance efficiency. It standardizes and automates deployment processes, reducing manual intervention and significantly simplifying operations. Its importance lies in improving deployment speed and application resilience, with use cases including continuous delivery of internet services and agile development of enterprise-level systems.

Core components include containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), and microservices architecture. These elements enable automated deployment, scalability, and consistency. Features include self-healing capabilities and high availability. In practical applications, CI/CD pipelines integrate testing and release processes, eliminating environment dependency issues and greatly improving development efficiency and fault recovery capabilities.

Implementation steps involve containerizing applications, configuring Kubernetes for automated deployment, and integrating CI/CD tools to enable one-click releases. This reduces human errors, accelerates software iteration cycles, and delivers business value by lowering operational costs, supporting rapid innovation, and enabling market responsiveness. Typical scenarios include minute-level updates and global scaling of web applications.
