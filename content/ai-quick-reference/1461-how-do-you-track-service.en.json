  "content": "Service dependency tracking monitors inter-service call dependencies in microservice architectures to ensure system health. Its importance lies in quickly locating the root cause of failures, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing observability. Application scenarios include troubleshooting, performance tuning, and resilience design, especially suitable for complex distributed systems such as e-commerce platforms processing order flows.\n\nIt is core-based on distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or Zipkin, with features including end-to-end trace ID propagation, dependency graph visualization, and low-intrusive data collection. The principle relies on injecting unique IDs into service call chains, combined with log and metric aggregation analysis. In practical applications, integration through the OpenTelemetry framework significantly improves MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery), reduces operational costs, and supports service meshes (such as Istio) for automatic monitoring.\n\nImplementation steps: First, integrate the tracing SDK into each microservice; second, configure cross-service propagation of trace IDs; finally, deploy data collectors and visualization tools. A typical scenario is tracking payment service dependencies in banking transaction systems. Business value is reflected in rapid fault isolation, 10%-30% latency optimization, and enhanced reliability of user experience."
