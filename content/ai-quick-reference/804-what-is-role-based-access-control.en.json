  "content": "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a core security mechanism for managing user or service account permissions in Kubernetes, with its core lying in the \"\"principle of least privilege\"\"—that is, only granting the minimum permissions required to complete specific tasks, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access. It is suitable for multi-tenant clusters and scenarios requiring fine-grained permission control.\n\nThe core components of RBAC include: Role (defines a set of permission rules within a namespace, such as Pod read and write), ClusterRole (cluster-scoped permissions), RoleBinding (binds a Role to users/groups in a specified namespace), and ClusterRoleBinding (cluster-level binding). Permission allocation is achieved by combining these objects. For example, define a \"\"developer Role\"\" that only allows querying Pods in a specific namespace, and then associate a user group through RoleBinding.\n\nIts application value lies in achieving security isolation and compliance management. Implementation requires three steps: 1) Create a Role/ClusterRole (e.g., `kubectl create role developer --verb=get,list --resource=pods`); 2) Create a RoleBinding to associate subjects (users/groups/ServiceAccounts); 3) Verify that permissions take effect. A typical scenario is restricting the operations team to only operate the production namespace to avoid data leakage risks caused by unauthorized operations."
