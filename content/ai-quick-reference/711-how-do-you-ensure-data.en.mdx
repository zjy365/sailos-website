Distributed cloud-native systems run distributed applications in the cloud using containerization and microservices. Data availability refers to the ability to ensure that data remains persistently accessible. Its importance lies in maintaining business continuity and system reliability, and it is applied in high-demand scenarios such as e-commerce order processing or financial services.

The core includes multiple data replicas, partitioned storage (such as sharding), and consistency protocols like Raft. The principle is to achieve data resilience through redundancy and automatic failover. In practical applications, combining Kubernetes StatefulSets and cloud storage services (such as AWS S3) ensures enhanced system elasticity and reduced downtime impact.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy multi-region redundant storage or object storage. 2. Configure automatic fault detection and recovery mechanisms. 3. Integrate monitoring and alert systems. It is typical in real-time data analysis platforms to ensure zero data loss. The business value is to improve service reliability, reduce losses, and meet strict SLA requirements.
