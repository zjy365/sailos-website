  "content": "Cloud-native data storage systems refer to data persistence solutions built on cloud environments such as Kubernetes, used for managing application data. Their importance lies in protecting sensitive data from leakage, ensuring compliance and business continuity, and they are widely applied in scenarios with high security requirements such as finance and e-commerce.\n\nCore components include identity authentication and access control, end-to-end encryption, audit logs, and backup and recovery mechanisms. Based on cloud-native characteristics like immutable infrastructure and service mesh, these features enable dynamic data protection and attack response, thereby enhancing system resilience, reducing security vulnerabilities, and supporting compliance with regulations such as GDPR.\n\nImplementation steps for protection: Implement the principle of least privilege access policy; enable encryption for data in transit and at rest; deploy real-time monitoring and log auditing; automate backup and disaster recovery testing. Business values include reducing security risks, meeting regulatory requirements, safeguarding corporate reputation, and minimizing losses from data loss."
