  "content": "The key principles of cloud-native application development are the guidelines for designing, building, and maintaining applications that run efficiently in cloud environments, emphasizing agility, resilience, and scalability. Their importance lies in supporting modern IT transformation and addressing dynamic business needs, such as rapid iteration and resource optimization in high-traffic services like e-commerce and finance.\n\nCore principles include microservices architecture, containerization, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), declarative APIs, and resilient design, supplemented by automated management. These features promote the resilience and fault tolerance of distributed systems, achieving high availability. In practical applications, they drive DevOps culture, optimize cloud resource usage, and enhance the speed and reliability of application releases.\n\nIts application value is reflected in accelerating innovation, reducing operational costs, and enhancing business continuity. It is suitable for building highly scalable and responsive cloud services, helping enterprises quickly adapt to market changes."
