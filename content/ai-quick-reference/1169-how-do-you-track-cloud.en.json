  "content": "Tracking cloud performance metrics across multi-cloud environments refers to monitoring key metrics (such as latency, throughput, error rate) of multiple cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) through unified tools. This ensures high availability, cost optimization, and rapid fault response, applied in cloud-native applications and hybrid cloud scenarios to support business continuity.\n\nCore components include a unified monitoring platform (e.g., Prometheus or Datadog), API integration, and aggregated dashboards. Features are automated data collection, real-time alerts, and multi-cloud compatibility. Practical applications improve resource utilization, avoid the impact of cloud lock-in, enhance the operational efficiency of DevOps teams, and optimize cross-cloud resource allocation.\n\nImplementation steps: select compatible tools (e.g., Grafana); integrate cloud service APIs; configure metric collection and aggregation; set up visualization and alerts. Typical scenarios include fault diagnosis and capacity planning, with business values of reducing downtime, lowering operational costs, and improving system reliability."
