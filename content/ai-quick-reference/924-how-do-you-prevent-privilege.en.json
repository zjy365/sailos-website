  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, privilege escalation refers to an attacker gaining unauthorized high-privilege access through vulnerabilities, such as container escape or service account abuse. This issue is critical as it can lead to data breaches, system damage, and compliance risks, especially in widely used container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, which is suitable for microservice architectures and auto-scaling scenarios.\n\nThe core principles include the failure of the least privilege principle, misconfigurations in RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and insufficient isolation of containers or Pods. Characteristics involve the abuse of privileged modes and unauthorized API calls. In practical applications, Kubernetes RBAC policies can restrict service account permissions, influence the cloud-native security posture, and enhance the overall system's defense capabilities.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1. Configuring the least privilege principle, such as defining limited roles using Kubernetes RBAC; 2. Isolating containers and enabling Pod Security Policies to restrict root access; 3. Regularly auditing configurations and service accounts; 4. Integrating tools like OPA or Falco for real-time monitoring. Typical scenarios include CI/CD pipelines in DevOps processes, with business values of reducing security incidents, ensuring compliance, and lowering operational risks."
