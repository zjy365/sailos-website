Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts define infrastructure automation through code, ensuring the reliability, consistency, and repeatability of deployments. Verifying their correctness before deployment in production environments is crucial to prevent configuration errors or security vulnerabilities from causing failures in cloud platforms such as Kubernetes or AWS, thereby improving overall operational efficiency.

The core of verification includes syntax checks (e.g., linters), security compliance scanning, dry run simulated deployments, and unit testing. These methods identify misconfigurations, permission issues, or resource conflicts, and when implemented in the staging environment in conjunction with CI/CD pipelines, they significantly increase deployment success rates and enhance security compliance.

Implementation steps: 1. Code review and linting. 2. Run dry run tests. 3. Test in the staging environment. 4. Integrate CI/CD automation. Typical scenarios include continuous deployment pipelines, and the business value is reflected in reducing the risk of production failures, lowering maintenance costs, and accelerating iterations.
