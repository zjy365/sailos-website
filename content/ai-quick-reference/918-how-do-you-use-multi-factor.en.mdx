Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to verify their identity through multiple independent factors, such as passwords and SMS verification codes. In cloud-native environments, it is crucial as it prevents data breaches and unauthorized access, enhancing the overall security of applications and data; typical applications include protecting Kubernetes cluster entry points and management consoles.

Its core components include knowledge factors (passwords), possession factors (hardware tokens), and biometric factors (fingerprints). The principle is based on multi-factor叠加验证 to reduce the risk of single credentials. In practical applications, it is often integrated with OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect protocols and deployed to API gateways or service meshes through services like Auth0 or Keycloak, affecting the strengthening of trust boundaries and compliance adherence in cloud-native architectures.

The steps to implement MFA are: select a provider (e.g., Google Authenticator), configure identity management system settings and policies, and deploy to Kubernetes using plugins such as Dex; typical scenarios include administrator login to CI/CD processes. Business values include reducing attack success rates, minimizing the risk of data loss, and supporting compliance with regulations such as GDPR.
