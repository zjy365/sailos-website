  "content": "During application updates, automated deployment tools such as Kubernetes or CI/CD pipelines manage load balancing and ensure zero-downtime deployment by dynamically adjusting traffic distribution. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining high service availability, allowing applications in cloud-native environments and microservice architectures to avoid user interruptions and support continuous delivery.\n\nThe core principles include rolling update strategies and readiness probe mechanisms. Tools gradually start new instances and perform health checks; load balancers (such as Ingress controllers) only route traffic to healthy nodes while gracefully taking down old instances. In practical applications, this enables seamless updates, improves deployment reliability and microservice stability, and reduces the impact of potential failures.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy new version instances and verify their health status. 2. Configure load balancers to gradually switch traffic to new instances. 3. Take down old instances and monitor traffic migration. Typical scenarios include blue-green or canary deployments, with business values including minimizing downtime risks, supporting A/B testing, and ensuring business continuity."
