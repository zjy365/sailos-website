In cloud-native applications, inter-service networking and communication processing involve distributed services interacting with data securely and reliably in dynamic container environments. It is crucial as it supports the resilience, scalability, and agile deployment of microservices architectures, with application scenarios including order processing in e-commerce platforms or API calls in real-time analytics systems.

Core components include Kubernetes service mechanisms for service discovery (exposing services via ClusterIP) and load balancing; network policies to restrict traffic between Pods; and service meshes like Istio that provide traffic management, mTLS encryption, and observability. The principle is to abstract network details, ensuring communication consistency and fault tolerance, with practical impacts including simplifying multi-service collaboration and enhancing overall system reliability.

Implementation steps: Define YAML to deploy Service resources; integrate service meshes such as Istio to install sidecar proxies; configure routing rules and security policies to support circuit breaking and monitoring. Typical scenarios include A/B testing or disaster recovery switching, with business value reflected in reduced latency, enhanced security, and decreased operational overhead.
