Monitoring microservices is a key practice for tracking service health, performance, and logs in distributed architectures, ensuring high availability, rapid fault diagnosis, and performance optimization, suitable for cloud-native applications and Kubernetes environments.

Core tools include Prometheus (open-source metrics collection with real-time query and alerting capabilities), Grafana (visualization dashboards supporting multi-data source integration), Jaeger or Zipkin (distributed tracing for call chain analysis), and the ELK Stack (log aggregation consisting of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). These tools are based on standardized protocols like OpenTelemetry, enhancing system visibility and simplifying operational decision-making. Practical impacts include reduced MTTR and improved resource utilization.

The application value lies in unifying monitoring data sources, supporting real-time alerts and root cause analysis. In business terms, it enhances user experience by improving service reliability, driving agile iteration and cost optimization.
