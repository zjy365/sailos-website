Communication between microservices refers to the interaction of distributed services over a network to achieve data exchange and control flow coordination. Its importance lies in ensuring system decoupling, scalability, and independence, with application scenarios including e-commerce order processing and real-time inventory updates in cloud-native environments.

The core components involve synchronous mechanisms (such as RESTful HTTP and gRPC APIs) and asynchronous methods (such as message queues Kafka or RabbitMQ), with features including service discovery, API gateways, and load balancing. In practical applications, it supports event-driven architecture, enhances system resilience and fault isolation capabilities, thereby optimizing resource utilization and response speed.

Processing steps include: defining a unified interface protocol, integrating service discovery tools (such as Consul), configuring load balancing and retry mechanisms, and ensuring data consistency. Typical scenarios include API calls between microservices or message publish-subscribe, and the business value is reflected in improving development efficiency, simplifying operation and maintenance, and enhancing system reliability.
