Cloud-native application security involves ensuring the security of applications in containerized, microservices architectures, combined with automation and scalability. In regulated industries such as finance, its importance lies in the need to meet strict compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, SOC 2), prevent data breaches, and ensure system reliability. Application scenarios include sensitive systems like online banking and payment processing, which require security measures to facilitate digital transformation.

Core components include zero-trust architecture (implementing least privilege access), container runtime scanning (e.g., Trivy for vulnerability detection), and Kubernetes security policies (e.g., RBAC and network policies). Features are based on DevSecOps principles, integrating security shifting left into CI/CD pipelines. Practical applications include data encryption (e.g., TLS for transmission), identity management (e.g., Open Policy Agent), enabling real-time threat detection and automated compliance auditing, reducing downtime risks, and enhancing customer trust.

Processing steps include: 1. Adopting compliance frameworks (e.g., NIST or ISO 27001). 2. Integrating security tools (e.g., Aqua Security) for automated scanning. 3. Configuring microservice isolation and encrypted storage. 4. Continuous monitoring (e.g., Prometheus for log auditing). 5. Regular risk assessments and penetration testing. Its business value is reducing non-compliance fines (e.g., up to 50% cost savings), improving operational efficiency, and supporting innovation and service scalability through security reliability.
