  "content": "Managing traffic routing in a multi-cloud environment requires implementing cross-cloud service distribution control. Its core value lies in enhancing application high availability, optimizing performance (such as就近访问), and improving cost efficiency, applicable to hybrid cloud deployment, disaster recovery switching, and global business expansion scenarios.\n\nKey implementation components include: global load balancers (e.g., Nginx Plus, F5 BIG-IP), DNS intelligent resolution services (e.g., Amazon Route 53, Cloudflare), and service meshes (e.g., Istio cross-cluster communication). Dynamic routing is achieved by defining traffic policies based on geographic location, latency detection, or cost, combined with health checks and failover mechanisms. Cloud-native solutions often utilize Kubernetes Federation or multi-cluster Ingress controllers for unified management.\n\nTypical implementation steps:\n\n1. Unified entry point: Configure a global DNS or load balancer as the traffic entry;\n\n2. Policy definition: Set routing rules (e.g., weighted traffic splitting, path matching);\n\n3. Health monitoring: Real-time detection of backend cloud service availability;\n\n4. Automated switching: Trigger cross-cloud migration in case of failure;\n\n5. Continuous optimization: Adjust policies based on performance metrics.\n\nBusiness value is reflected in reducing downtime losses, avoiding cloud vendor lock-in risks, and enhancing end-user experience."
