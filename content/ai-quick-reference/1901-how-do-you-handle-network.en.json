  "content": "Network configuration handling for cloud-native applications manages communication between microservices in containerized environments, ensuring reliable, secure, and resilient connections. Its importance lies in supporting service discovery, load balancing, and fault isolation, with key application scenarios including microservice architectures deployed on Kubernetes platforms to enhance scalability and resilience.\n\nCore components such as Kubernetes Service implement internal service discovery and load balancing, Ingress manages external traffic routing, and Network Policies provide network security isolation. The principle relies on CNI plugins to automatically assign IPs and establish network models, simplifying operations and maintenance. In practical applications, this reduces human errors through automated configuration, optimizes resource utilization, and supports multi-cloud deployment to enhance application high availability and compliance.\n\nImplementation steps include defining Service resources to expose service ports, deploying Ingress controllers to configure HTTPS routing, and applying Network Policies to restrict access between Pods. Typical scenarios involve microservice integration in e-commerce platforms, with business value reflected in efficient operations, robust security policies, and rapid iteration capabilities, driving lower latency and higher business resilience."
