Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the management of cloud infrastructure through code, enabling consistent deployment and version control. Integrating automated backups is crucial for ensuring data reliability, with application scenarios including disaster recovery and compliant cloud environment deployments, reducing manual errors and enhancing continuity.

The core is embedding backup configurations into IaC tools such as Terraform or Ansible, defining backup frequency, retention policies, and recovery point objectives. The principle is based on declarative code that invokes cloud services like AWS Backup API or Azure Backup for automated execution. In practical applications, cross-region redundant backups can be built to improve system resilience and support auto-scaling requirements.

Implementation steps: 1. Select compatible backup tools (e.g., Velero or cloud-native services); 2. Declare backup jobs in IaC code and test; 3. Integrate CI/CD pipelines such as GitLab CI to trigger regular backups. A typical scenario is data recovery for multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters. Business values include automated maintenance costs and 99.9% availability guarantee.
