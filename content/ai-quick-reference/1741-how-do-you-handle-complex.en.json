  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform and CloudFormation automate the management of cloud resources through code, enhancing deployment consistency and repeatability. Their key importance lies in handling complex multi-component cloud environments, reducing manual errors, and supporting rapidly scalable application scenarios like distributed systems.\n\nCore components include declarative configuration, state management, and modular design, with principles based on version control-driven change automation. In practical applications, it simplifies the implementation of cloud-native architectures, supports disaster recovery and blue-green deployments, and significantly improves DevOps efficiency.\n\nWhen actually using IaC to handle complex deployments, configuration files are defined and commands such as \"\"terraform apply\"\" are executed. Typical steps include resource coding and state change management, with values including a 50% reduction in deployment time, fewer human errors, and improved business agility."
