  "content": "Microservices is a software architectural style that splits monolithic applications into independent small services, each responsible for specific functions. Containerized applications package the runtime environment and dependencies using technologies like Docker to ensure consistency. This combination is crucial in cloud-native environments, supporting elastic scaling and efficient resource management, and is commonly used in high-availability systems such as e-commerce platforms.\n\nMicroservices support containerization through lightweight, loosely coupled design: each service can be packaged into an independent container image, enabling resource isolation and quick startup. Core features include service autonomy and API communication; when combined with orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage service instances, high availability is ensured. In practical applications, this accelerates DevOps processes, simplifies deployment, and enhances system fault tolerance.\n\nImplementation steps include: decomposing the application into microservices; containerizing each service and its dependencies; orchestrating and deploying with Kubernetes. Typical scenarios include large-scale API services, with business values covering agile releases, isolation of partial failures, and cost optimization brought by elastic resource scaling."
