Microservices architecture is a software design approach that decomposes large applications into small, independent services. Its importance lies in supporting modular development and enhancing the flexibility of development teams. Application scenarios include cloud-native systems, e-commerce and financial platforms, facilitating rapid response to business needs.

Core components include service autonomy, loosely coupled interfaces, and independent deployment mechanisms. Features such as technological diversity and scalability enable efficient service management through containerization and Kubernetes orchestration. In practical applications, it accelerates development cycles, reduces the risk of single points of failure, and promotes agile development and continuous delivery.

Steps to enhance flexibility are: first, decompose the monolithic application into independent services; second, teams develop and test their respective services in parallel; finally, automate deployment through CI/CD. Typical scenarios support rapid iterative updates, bringing business values such as shortened time to market and improved customer responsiveness.
