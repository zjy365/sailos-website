  "content": "Environment variables are configurable parameters used to dynamically adjust application behavior and avoid hard-coding sensitive data such as API keys. In CI/CD pipelines, they ensure consistency, security, and maintainability. Application scenarios include deployment configurations, database connections, and environment-specific settings (e.g., from Dev to Prod stages) to support automated testing and releases.\n\nCore components include secure storage (such as HashiCorp Vault or cloud Secrets Manager), version control integration, and environment grouping. Features involve encryption, dynamic injection, and declarative management, with confidential protection implemented through tools. The principle is to reference variables in pipeline scripts without affecting the codebase. Practical applications enhance security, prevent information leakage, ensure multi-environment consistency, and accelerate the development process.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Store sensitive variables in secure management tools. 2. Configure variable references in CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions). 3. Stage environment settings such as testing and production. Typical scenarios include automated builds injecting different database credentials. Business value lies in reducing deployment errors, enhancing compliance, and improving efficiency."
