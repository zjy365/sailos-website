  "content": "SSL/TLS is an encryption protocol that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of network communications. In cloud-native applications, it provides a secure barrier for transmission between distributed services, preventing data leakage and man-in-the-middle attacks, and is applied to API calls, microservice interactions, and ingress traffic protection.\n\nIts core includes certificate management (such as automatic issuance and rotation), handshake protocol (AES encryption algorithm), and mutual authentication (mTLS). In cloud-native practices, it is implemented through Kubernetes Ingress or service meshes like Istio to ensure end-to-end encryption between microservices. The impact is strengthening the overall security architecture, supporting the zero-trust model, and meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR.\n\nIn application, TLS termination is configured at the gateway or API server in Kubernetes; the value lies in reducing attack risks, ensuring the privacy of sensitive data, and enhancing the credibility and business resilience of cloud-native applications."
