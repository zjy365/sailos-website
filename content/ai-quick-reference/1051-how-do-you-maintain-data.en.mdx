Maintaining data synchronization in a hybrid cloud environment involves ensuring that data remains consistent and available between on-premises data centers and one or more public cloud platforms. Its importance lies in supporting business continuity, disaster recovery strategies, optimizing data locality access, and meeting regulatory compliance requirements, making it one of the core supporting capabilities of hybrid cloud architectures.

The key to implementation lies in several core components: synchronization strategies (real-time, near-real-time, or batch processing), metadata management, change data capture mechanisms, and the choice between strong consistency or eventual consistency. Common technologies include cloud storage gateways, object-based cross-cloud replication, master-slave replication or bidirectional synchronization of distributed databases, and specialized data synchronization tools (such as AWS DataSync, Azure File Sync, Velero cross-cluster application migration backup). A reliable network connection (usually requiring dedicated lines or VPN), secure transmission (TLS/SSL), and identity access management (IAM) are fundamental guarantees. This effectively supports scenarios such as cross-cloud application distribution, cross-environment analysis, data sharing in development and testing environments, and multi-region backup.

Practical implementation steps: First, clearly define data classification, synchronization frequency (RPO/RTO), and consistency requirements. Second, select tools and platform services (such as cloud-native replication services or third-party tools like Rsync, SyncThing). Configure data sources and targets, and set filtering rules and security policies (encryption, key management). Finally, deploy synchronization agents or tasks, and establish monitoring alerts and regular verification mechanisms. This brings the value of business agility, cost optimization (hot and cold data tiering), improved disaster recovery capabilities, and avoidance of vendor lock-in.
