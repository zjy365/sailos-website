Application Performance Monitoring (APM) refers to a system that tracks performance metrics of software applications through tools and methods. It is crucial for cloud-native environments, ensuring application reliability, optimizing performance, and enhancing user experience. In distributed microservice architectures and containerized platforms (such as Kubernetes), APM addresses the complexity of dynamic environments, with application scenarios including fault diagnosis and resource management.

The core of APM includes metrics tracking (such as latency and error rates), log analysis, and distributed tracing (such as Jaeger integration), characterized by real-time monitoring, automatic alerts, and root cause diagnosis. In practical applications, it can quickly identify bottlenecks (such as insufficient pod resources) and optimize microservice interactions; its impact on related fields is reflected in improving DevOps efficiency, supporting SLO/SLA compliance, and reducing operational costs.

The value of APM lies in enhancing business continuity and user satisfaction. For example, automated performance optimization is achieved through tools (such as Prometheus), with typical applications including rapid fault response and continuous delivery optimization, ultimately improving the stability and competitiveness of cloud applications.
