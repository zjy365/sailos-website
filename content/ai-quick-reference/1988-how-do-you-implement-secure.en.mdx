Secure and seamless updates of cloud-native applications are implemented on platforms like Kubernetes, with importance lying in ensuring high availability and compliance. Application scenarios include zero-downtime deployments in continuous delivery.

The core principles involve rolling updates, blue-green deployments, or canary release strategies, characterized by container isolation, automated testing, and vulnerability scanning. Direct impacts are risk reduction and improved operational efficiency, such as automated security audits in DevOps.

Implementation steps include: pre-deployment testing; integrating CI/CD pipelines to execute rolling updates; monitoring metrics and setting up rollback mechanisms. Typical values are enhanced reliability, reduced operational costs, and improved security standards.
