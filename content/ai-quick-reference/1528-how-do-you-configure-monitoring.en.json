  "content": "Event-driven microservices enable inter-service communication through asynchronous events (such as messages), enhancing resilience, scalability, and decoupling. This architecture is crucial in real-time data processing, e-commerce order flows, or IoT platforms, supporting efficient resource utilization and event-driven responses.\n\nThe core components include event producers, message brokers (e.g., Kafka), and consumer components, characterized by distribution, event sourcing, and eventual consistency. In practice, monitoring needs to track event latency, throughput, and error rates, which affect system reliability. For example, metrics can reveal bottlenecks to ensure the integrity of business processes.\n\nConfiguration steps: 1. Deploy tools like Prometheus to monitor producer/consumer latency and message queue status. 2. Integrate tracing frameworks such as Jaeger to track event correlation. 3. Set up alerts to handle failed events and performance thresholds. Applied in inventory update scenarios, it improves fault response speed, ensures business continuity, and reduces operational risks."
