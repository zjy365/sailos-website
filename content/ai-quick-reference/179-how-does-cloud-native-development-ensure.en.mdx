Cloud-native development is an approach that leverages cloud computing features to build elastic and scalable applications, ensuring seamless deployment of containerized applications and achieving zero-downtime update processes. Its importance lies in enhancing application availability and agility, with application scenarios including continuous release and fault recovery for e-commerce platforms.

The core components include CI/CD pipelines (automated building, testing, and deployment), container orchestration (such as Kubernetes managing rolling updates and rollbacks), and health check mechanisms. Features like dynamic resource configuration and blue-green deployment ensure the gradual replacement of instances, reducing risks. In practical applications, this improves deployment reliability, significantly reduces downtime, and promotes the efficient expansion of the cloud-native ecosystem.

Implementation steps: First, integrate CI/CD tools such as Jenkins for code automation; then configure Kubernetes deployment strategies like canary releases; finally, enable service meshes to monitor operational health. Typical scenarios involve updating web applications under a microservices architecture; business values include zero-downtime deployment, accelerated iteration, and optimized resource costs.
