  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure deployment using code, essential for consistent, repeatable setups in cloud-native environments. Automatic rollback ensures quick recovery from deployment failures, reducing downtime and risks to application availability, such as in CI/CD pipelines for microservices architecture.\n\nIaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation maintain state files to track infrastructure versions. Core features include version control and declarative definitions; on deployment failure, they revert to a prior stable state, enabling near real-time recovery and minimizing human intervention across scenarios like Kubernetes cluster updates.\n\nImplement by storing IaC state in secure backends (e.g., Terraform Cloud or S3), integrate CI/CD stages with automated pre-deploy validation and rollback triggers. Steps: commit changes via Git, validate via tests; if deploy fails, script a rollback command to reapply a previous state. Business value: enhances resilience, cuts operational costs, and ensures service continuity."
