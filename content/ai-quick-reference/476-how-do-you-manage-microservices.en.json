  "content": "Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes automate the management of the microservices lifecycle, covering development, deployment, scaling, and decommissioning phases to ensure reliability and resilience. Their importance lies in simplifying operations, supporting high availability and scalability, and being suitable for cloud-native applications and distributed system scenarios.\n\nCore components include declarative configuration, automatic scheduling, service discovery, and rolling updates. Services are defined through YAML files, and the tool automatically handles health checks, load balancing, and fault recovery. In practical applications, it improves resource utilization, promotes CI/CD integration, reduces operational burden, and enhances system availability.\n\nImplementation steps include: containerizing microservice images; defining deployment and service configurations for the orchestration tool; deploying using CLI tools and monitoring status; performing rolling updates or scaling; and finally decommissioning services. A typical scenario is CI/CD pipelines, with business values of improving application resilience, reducing costs, and accelerating innovation iterations."
