Automated deployment uses scripts and tools to automatically execute application release tasks, reducing human intervention. Its importance lies in improving release efficiency and reliability, and it is applied in cloud-native environments such as CI/CD pipelines to ensure rapid iteration.

The core includes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or Kubernetes Operators), which implement version control by defining repeatable deployment scripts. Features such as automated testing and consistency verification eliminate configuration drift, ensure consistent deployment across all environments (e.g., development, production), and improve system stability.

During implementation, build an automated pipeline: 1. Use tools to define deployment steps. 2. Integrate test automation to verify functionality. 3. Apply consistently to all environments. This accelerates delivery, reduces downtime, and lowers costs.
