Cloud-native environments are built on cloud services and container technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, offering portability, elasticity, and automated deployment. Their importance lies in supporting efficient development cycles, with application scenarios including cross-platform development—such as the seamless operation from a local Windows laptop to a cloud Linux server—ensuring consistent application performance in hybrid cloud or multi-vendor environments.

Core components include containerized packaged applications and Kubernetes for orchestrating and managing microservices architectures. Features like environment isolation and declarative configuration enable platform independence. In practical applications, developers can deploy on different operating systems or cloud platforms without modifying code, reducing compatibility issues, promoting DevOps practices, and enhancing agility.

Implementation steps involve: containerizing applications into Docker images; defining resource orchestration using Kubernetes; and automating testing and deployment through CI/CD pipelines. Typical scenarios include hybrid cloud migration or multi-platform deployment. Business value encompasses reducing lock-in risks, accelerating time-to-market, and optimizing resource costs.
