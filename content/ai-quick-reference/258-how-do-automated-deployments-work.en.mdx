Automate the automated software release process to ensure fast and consistent application deployment. Terraform, as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, manages the creation and update of cloud resources such as computing instances and networks. The importance of their combination lies in accelerating DevOps delivery and reducing error rates; application scenarios include CI/CD pipelines in cloud-native environments (such as AWS or Azure) to achieve end-to-end automation.

The core principle is complementary collaboration: Terraform defines the infrastructure state and传递s information through output variables, while deployment tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI are responsible for the deployment of application code. Features include API integration and infrastructure changes triggering subsequent deployment steps. In practical applications, after Terraform updates the Kubernetes cluster, deployment tools perform rolling updates, significantly improving agility, scalability, and resource utilization efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate the CI/CD pipeline, add Terraform configuration and run ""apply"" to update the infrastructure. 2. Use outputs (such as IP addresses) to set deployment environment variables. 3. Call deployment scripts (such as Kubernetes' Helm) to release the application. A typical scenario is in containerized deployment where infrastructure and applications are updated simultaneously. Business values include continuous delivery, cost optimization, and rapid fault recovery.
