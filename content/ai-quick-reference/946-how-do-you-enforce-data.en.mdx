Data access control in cloud-native environments is a mechanism for managing data access permissions to ensure security, compliance, and privacy. Its importance lies in preventing unauthorized access and data breaches, with application scenarios including containerized microservices, multi-tenant applications, and industries with strict compliance requirements such as finance and healthcare.

Core components include authentication (e.g., OpenID Connect), authorization policies (principle of least privilege), and service integration. Kubernetes RBAC is used to define roles and role bindings, and service meshes like Istio enable microservice-level traffic control and encryption. In practical applications, it reduces the risk of data leakage, supports dynamic policy updates, and enhances the overall architecture's scalability and resilience.

Implementation steps: 1. Define access policies based on user/service roles. 2. Configure Kubernetes RBAC (e.g., Role/ClusterRole). 3. Integrate identity providers such as SAML/OIDC. 4. Deploy service meshes to implement network policies. Business values include enhanced security, compliance with regulations like GDPR, improved deployment agility, and cost efficiency.
