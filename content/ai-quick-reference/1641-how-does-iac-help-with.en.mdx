Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a core practice for automatically managing infrastructure through code, enhancing application scalability and resilience in cloud-native environments. Its importance lies in ensuring infrastructure consistency and repeatability, with application scenarios including containerized deployments such as Kubernetes clusters, supporting efficient dynamic resource allocation.

Core features include defining infrastructure states using declarative tools (e.g., Terraform or AWS CloudFormation), supporting version control and automated deployment. In cloud-native environments, IaC enables elastic scaling of applications, for example, by defining Kubernetes deployment resources and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler policies to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on load changes; it enhances reliability, reduces human errors, and optimizes cloud resource utilization.

Implementation steps involve: first, templating infrastructure with IaC tools (e.g., defining cluster size and scaling rules); then integrating CI/CD pipelines and monitoring systems to trigger automatic scaling (e.g., based on CPU/memory metrics); its business value lies in cost optimization, high availability, and agile response to demand fluctuations.
