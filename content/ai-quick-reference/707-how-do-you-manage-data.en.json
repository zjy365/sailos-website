  "content": "Cross-cloud data management refers to the process of coordinating data access and protection across different cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) to ensure consistency and avoid vendor lock-in. Its importance lies in supporting business resilience, disaster recovery, and cost optimization, applied in multi-cloud strategies and data migration scenarios.\n\nCore components include data replication tools (e.g., AWS DMS), API integration layers, and unified governance policies, ensuring security and scalability based on standard protocols. In practical applications, cross-cloud data pipelines are implemented through Kubernetes-orchestrated persistent volumes or SaaS services, facilitating hybrid cloud deployment and operational efficiency improvement.\n\nImplementation steps: Define data requirements; select tools (e.g., Velero backup, Cloud Dataflow); deploy synchronization mechanisms; monitor performance. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud data lake analysis, delivering values such as risk reduction and resource optimization."
