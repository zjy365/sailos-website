  "content": "Implementing API management in a multi-cloud environment involves unified management of the API lifecycle, including publishing, security, and monitoring, across multiple cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. Its importance lies in ensuring cross-cloud API consistency and interoperability, avoiding vendor lock-in, and enhancing scalability. Application scenarios include globally distributed systems or hybrid cloud architectures.\n\nCore components include API gateways (e.g., Kong or AWS API Gateway), service registration and discovery (e.g., Kubernetes service mesh Istio), and policy engines (e.g., authentication and rate limiting). Features include support for cross-cloud connectivity and unified policy enforcement. In practical applications, deployment is based on Kubernetes or dedicated tools (e.g., Apigee), and traffic routing and security control are achieved through service mesh integration, significantly improving resilience, reducing operational costs, and enhancing observability.\n\nImplementation steps: First, select a multi-cloud API management tool; second, deploy a unified gateway and policies; third, configure cross-cloud routing and API publishing; fourth, implement monitoring and security policy updates. Business values include unified management to reduce complexity, accelerated API publishing, improved security, and support for agile development. Typical scenarios cover global API services in finance or IoT device management."
