Containers are lightweight, portable execution units. Cloud-native application development uses containers to efficiently build, deploy, and manage microservices in cloud environments. Their importance lies in improving development efficiency, ensuring environment consistency, and being suitable for CI/CD pipelines, hybrid clouds, and DevOps practice scenarios.

Container technology features include environment isolation, resource efficiency, and deployment agility. Core platforms like Docker provide runtime standardization. In practical applications, they support the decoupling of microservice architectures, accelerate iteration cycles, simplify cross-cloud deployment, significantly improve resource utilization and application elasticity, and drive digital transformation.

Benefits include accelerating development processes, enhancing scalability and reliability, while reducing infrastructure costs. Business value is reflected in faster time-to-market, high availability, and flexible innovation response capabilities.
