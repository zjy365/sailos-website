  "content": "Monitoring microservice performance metrics involves collecting and analyzing key system data (such as latency, throughput, and error rates) to evaluate service health, ensuring the reliability of distributed architectures and enabling rapid fault response. This is crucial for real-time applications in e-commerce, finance, etc., to prevent downtime and optimize user experience.\n\nCore components include system metrics (CPU, memory), business metrics (e.g., request success rate), log aggregation, and distributed tracing (e.g., link tracing). Tools like Prometheus for data collection, Grafana for visual dashboards, and Jaeger for call chain tracing enhance observability, reduce fault recovery time, and optimize resource efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy metric collection tools (e.g., Prometheus agent); 2. Configure logging and tracing systems (e.g., Jaeger); 3. Establish dashboards and alert rules; 4. Regularly tune thresholds. Typical scenarios: troubleshooting performance bottlenecks. Business values include improving service stability and user satisfaction, and reducing operational costs."
