IaC (Infrastructure as Code) defines and manages infrastructure resources through code, replacing manual configuration operations. Its importance lies in improving consistency, repeatability, and traceability, and it is widely used in cloud environment deployment, configuration management, and disaster recovery scenarios, significantly reducing the risks of manual operations.

Its core components include declarative code (such as Terraform or CloudFormation templates), version control systems (such as Git), and automated execution engines (such as CI/CD pipelines). IaC code clearly describes the target state, and the system automatically compares and converges differences, eliminating ambiguities and omissions in manual configuration. Version control records all change histories, facilitating auditing and rollbacks.

Implementation steps: 1) Write declarative templates to define resources; 2) Submit code to the version repository to trigger automated testing; 3) CI/CD pipelines verify and deploy changes. Business values: Avoid manual misconfigurations (such as incorrectly opening ports in security groups), ensure environmental consistency (alignment of development/production environments), improve change reliability (changes undergo code reviews first), and enhance disaster recovery efficiency (quick environment reconstruction through code).
