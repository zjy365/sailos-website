  "content": "Observability tools monitor behavioral data (such as logs, metrics, traces) of cloud-native applications, while cloud-native security tools (such as runtime protection tools) detect and respond to threats. Integration is crucial as it enhances overall visualization and security posture, applied in Kubernetes environments to ensure operational stability and compliance auditing.\n\nThe core includes unified data pipelines, API interfaces, and event-driven mechanisms. Observability tools provide context (e.g., Falco alerts), and security tools enforce policy controls. In practical applications, integration enables automated threat response (such as abnormal behavior analysis), reduces blind spots and false positives, and significantly improves DevSecOps efficiency and threat mitigation capabilities.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Configure tool compatibility (e.g., Prometheus and Falco). 2. Integrate data sources (via Service Mesh or log forwarding). 3. Set up automated workflows (alerts trigger responses). Typical scenarios include security incident diagnosis and compliance monitoring. Business value lies in accelerating mean response time, reducing operational costs, and lowering security risks."
