  "content": "Cloud-native development platforms are application development and deployment frameworks designed for cloud environments, focusing on containerization, microservices, and automation. Their importance in public cloud deployment lies in enhancing agility, scalability, and resource utilization, with use cases including running elastic applications and microservice architectures on clouds like AWS and Azure.\n\nCore components include Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and microservice architectures. Key features are automated deployment, elastic scaling, and fault recovery. During actual deployment, the platform integrates public cloud APIs and cloud-native tools such as service meshes to achieve seamless resource configuration and application management, significantly improving operational efficiency and observability.\n\nDeployment steps: Select cloud services (e.g., EKS or AKS), containerize applications, configure automated CI/CD, and integrate monitoring tools. Business value is reflected in cost reduction, accelerated release cycles, and support for high-availability scenarios such as e-commerce and IoT platforms."
