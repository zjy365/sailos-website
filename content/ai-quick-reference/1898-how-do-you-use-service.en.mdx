A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that manages inter-service communication in cloud-native applications, automatically handling network operations such as load balancing and security policies through injected proxies. Its importance lies in abstracting communication complexity, enhancing resilience, security, and observability. It is suitable for scenarios in microservices architectures, such as failure recovery and traffic control, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than network details.

The core components include the control plane (e.g., Istio) that defines routing and policies, and the data plane (e.g., Envoy proxies) that executes communication tasks; features include traffic management, mTLS encryption, and telemetry collection. In practical applications, it separates network logic from application code, facilitating DevOps collaboration, with impacts including simplified deployment, enhanced observability, and improved service reliability.

Implementation steps involve deploying the control plane tool, injecting sidecar proxies (for example, in Kubernetes), and configuring virtual services and policies. Typical use cases include canary releases and A/B testing, delivering business value such as elastic scaling, reduced latency, and security compliance management.
