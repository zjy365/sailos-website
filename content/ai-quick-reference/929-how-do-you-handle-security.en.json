  "content": "Cloud-native data pipelines refer to data processing workflows that use containers, microservices, and Kubernetes orchestration on cloud platforms. Their security is crucial for protecting sensitive information (such as user data) from leakage, and they are applied in scenarios like financial analysis or real-time log processing.\n\nCore components include identity management (e.g., RBAC), data encryption (in transit and at rest), network policies (Kubernetes Network Policies), and monitoring and auditing. These are implemented based on a zero-trust architecture and enhanced with service meshes (e.g., Istio) to significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and facilitate compliance (e.g., GDPR).\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Configure authentication and access control. 2. Encrypt data sources and storage. 3. Apply network isolation policies. 4. Integrate continuous monitoring tools. A typical scenario is a multi-tenant data processing environment, whose business value lies in improving data integrity and business resilience."
