Data partitioning is a method of dividing large datasets into logical subsets. In a microservices architecture, it enhances service independence and scalability, avoids monolithic database bottlenecks, and is suitable for high-traffic applications such as e-commerce platforms.

It core involves partitioning strategies (such as shard key selection) and load balancing mechanisms, with features including fault tolerance and low-latency access. In principle, it supports horizontal scaling by distributing data storage pressure; in practical applications, partitioning data in user services can optimize query performance and facilitate elastic deployment.

Its role is reflected in improving system performance and availability, and reducing dependencies between services through data isolation. Its value lies in enhancing business agility, supporting large-scale expansion, and reducing operational risks.
