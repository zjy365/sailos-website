  "content": "Cloud-native data management leverages containerization, Kubernetes, and other technologies to manage the data lifecycle in cloud environments, which is crucial for DevOps. It provides fast and consistent data access, backup, and recovery through automation, ensuring seamless environmental consistency in microservices and CI/CD pipelines, and accelerating testing and production iterations.\n\nCore features include declarative configuration (such as Kubernetes StatefulSets), scalable persistent storage, and automated backup and recovery mechanisms. This achieves high data availability and version control, eliminates data bottlenecks in DevOps, supports seamless data migration and consistent deployment across environments, and improves team collaboration and delivery speed.\n\nHow to support DevOps: Implementation steps include integrating data management into CI/CD pipelines (such as using Velero for automatic backups) and performing database schema migrations (such as during blue-green deployments); typical scenarios include automatic reconstruction of test data. Business value lies in shortening software release cycles, reducing failure risks, and optimizing resource utilization."
