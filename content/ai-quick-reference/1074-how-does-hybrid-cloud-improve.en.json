  "content": "Hybrid cloud combines private and public cloud resources, allowing flexible deployment of workloads in different locations worldwide. Its core value lies in significantly reducing the physical distance and network hops of data transmission by placing application components or data in cloud facilities or edge nodes that are geographically closer to end-users, thereby directly lowering network latency. This is crucial for global applications that rely on low-latency responses, such as online gaming, real-time collaboration, and financial trading platforms.\n\nThe core mechanism by which hybrid cloud improves latency is leveraging the globally distributed infrastructure of public cloud providers and private cloud/edge nodes. Key implementations include:\n\n1. Edge computing: Processing requests or caching data at edge nodes in user-dense areas to reduce origin server retrieval.\n\n2. Global load balancing: Intelligent DNS (e.g., GSLB) routes user requests to available sites (public cloud regions or private clouds) with the lowest geographical and network latency.\n\n3. Data localization: Sensitive or frequently accessed data can be stored in private clouds or specific public cloud regions; non-sensitive, static content is accelerated and distributed via CDN.\n\n4. Architectural decoupling: Deploying front-end and user interaction layers on public cloud edges close to users, with back-end processing in central cloud or private cloud, optimizing the overall response path.\n\nImplementation steps and value:\n\n1. Assess user distribution: Identify the geographical locations of main user groups.\n\n2. Deploy hybrid architecture: Deploy access points in target regions' public cloud/edge, and central business/data in private cloud or core cloud.\n\n3. Configure intelligent routing: Enable cloud providers' GSLB or third-party solutions.\n\n4. Utilize CDN caching: Accelerate static resources.\n\n5. Results:\n\nSignificantly reduce end-to-end latency (tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and enhance user experience.\n\nImprove the response speed, availability, and competitiveness of global applications.\n\nSupport business scenarios with stringent real-time requirements (e.g., IoT, online interaction)."
