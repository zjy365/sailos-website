  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, ensuring the confidentiality (preventing unauthorized access to data) and integrity (preventing data tampering) of applications is crucial to protect sensitive information, meet compliance requirements such as GDPR, and prevent data breaches or malicious modifications. This applies to scenarios like microservices architectures and Kubernetes clusters to ensure the overall security and trustworthiness of the system.\n\nCore strategies include using Kubernetes Secrets to securely store passwords and tokens, implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict permissions, encrypting data in transit via TLS, applying network policies to isolate traffic between services, and enabling audit logs for real-time monitoring. These measures are based on the zero-trust model and enhance security through service meshes like Istio, significantly reducing attack risks and improving deployment resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: First, create Secrets in Kubernetes to manage confidential information; second, configure RBAC policies for fine-grained access control; third, enable encrypted storage and data transmission; finally, deploy tools like Prometheus to monitor activities and conduct regular log audits. Business values include reducing security risks, enhancing customer trust, supporting agile development, and ensuring compliance."
