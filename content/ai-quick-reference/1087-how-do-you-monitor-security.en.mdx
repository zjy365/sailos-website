Monitoring security vulnerabilities across multiple cloud environments refers to the unified management of potential risk points in multi-cloud deployments, such as configuration errors or malicious activities. It is crucial for ensuring data security and achieving compliance (e.g., GDPR), and is widely used by hybrid cloud enterprises to prevent large-scale attacks.

The core components include Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools, API integrations, and lightweight agents; features include centralized visibility, automated scanning, and AI-driven analysis; the principle is to identify vulnerabilities by aggregating log, configuration, and event data; practical applications cover real-time alerts, remediation recommendations, and risk reporting, reducing response time to minutes and enhancing cloud-native protection capabilities.

Implementation steps: 1. Select and deploy a CSPM platform (e.g., Prisma Cloud or Wiz). 2. Integrate all cloud accounts and collect data via APIs or agents. 3. Configure customized scanning policies (e.g., weekly baseline checks). 4. Set up alert and automatic response mechanisms. 5. Regularly review and optimize policies. Typical scenarios involve multi-region cloud deployments; business value includes reducing intrusion risks by 20-40%, improving compliance efficiency, and saving costs.
