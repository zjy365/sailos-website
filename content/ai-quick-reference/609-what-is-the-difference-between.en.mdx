SQL databases are relational and use Structured Query Language to manage data; NoSQL is non-relational and supports flexible data models. In cloud storage, the distinction is crucial: SQL ensures transactional integrity, suitable for high-consistency scenarios such as finance; NoSQL facilitates horizontal scaling and elastic storage, used in big data applications like IoT or social media.

Core features of SQL include fixed schemas, ACID transactions, and JOIN operations, enabling strong data consistency; NoSQL features schema-less design, the BASE principle (eventual consistency), and diverse models (e.g., key-value or document). Its practical applications in cloud computing are reflected in: SQL serving traditional systems like OLTP transactions; NoSQL driving distributed architectures such as real-time analytics platforms to enhance scalability.

In applications, SQL databases ensure data integrity and complex queries, used in CRM or accounting systems; NoSQL provides high throughput and cost-effectiveness, supporting rapid development such as user data management. Business values include SQL's reliability guarantee; NoSQL's adaptability to cope with dynamic growth.
