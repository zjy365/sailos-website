Configuration data management in cloud-native applications refers to the dynamic storage and access of application settings (such as environment variables and connection parameters). Its importance lies in supporting environment consistency, security, and elastic scaling. Application scenarios include configuration decoupling of independent services in microservice architectures and automation of CI/CD pipelines.

Core components include Kubernetes ConfigMaps (for handling non-sensitive data) and Secrets (for encrypting sensitive data), with key-value pair persistence achieved through distributed storage like etcd. Its features are based on declarative configuration and API-driven updates, enabling hot reloading and version control. In practical applications, it improves portability and fault tolerance, reducing deployment disruptions.

Implementation steps: 1. Create ConfigMap/Secret YAML resources to define configuration data. 2. Mount them to Pod environment variables or volumes to ensure real-time updates. 3. Integrate sensitive data using external storage such as HashiCorp Vault. Typical scenarios include switching multi-environment configurations, improving deployment efficiency, and ensuring security compliance. The business value is reducing operational costs and accelerating release cycles.
