The ELK Stack, composed of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, is a centralized log management solution. It efficiently collects, stores, and analyzes log data, playing a crucial role in cloud-native environments, DevOps, and security monitoring, supporting fault diagnosis and system observability.

Core components include Elasticsearch (distributed storage and indexing), Logstash (data processing pipeline), and Kibana (data visualization). Its features are scalability, real-time processing capabilities, enabling log aggregation and querying. In practical applications, it improves log management efficiency for container platforms like Kubernetes, optimizing operations and异常检测.

Implementation steps: First, deploy an Elasticsearch cluster to store logs; then configure Logstash pipelines to collect log sources using input plugins, filter, and output to Elasticsearch; finally, deploy Kibana to create dashboards for data analysis. Typical scenarios include cloud application monitoring, and the business value is enhancing observability and reducing fault response time.
