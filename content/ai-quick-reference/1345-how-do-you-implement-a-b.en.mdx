CI/CD pipelines automate software building, testing, and deployment to ensure efficient and reliable releases. A/B testing randomly divides users into groups A and B to compare performance metrics of different feature versions. Integrating them enables rapid iteration and low-risk experimentation, applied in scenarios such as optimizing web interfaces and improving features to enhance user experience and business metrics.

The core components include feature flags for traffic control, A/B testing frameworks (e.g., LaunchDarkly or Split), and CI/CD tool integration (e.g., Jenkins). The principle is to gradually expose new versions to some users during deployment, collect metrics (such as conversion rates), and decide on full release or rollback after data analysis. This reduces deployment risks, supports data-driven continuous improvement, and impacts development process optimization.

Implementation steps: 1. Add feature flags to the codebase; 2. Integrate testing tools into CI/CD scripts; 3. Deploy changes and set user group variables; 4. Monitor real-time metrics; 5. Promote or adjust based on results. A typical scenario is testing changes to the shopping cart process. Business values include increasing conversion rates, revenue, and user satisfaction, while reducing error costs.
