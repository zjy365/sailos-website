The integration of on-premises systems with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud deployments refers to connecting an enterprise's internal IT infrastructure with multiple public cloud services (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) or hybrid clouds (private cloud plus public cloud) to achieve unified resource management, elastic scaling, and business continuity. Its importance lies in enhancing agility, cost optimization, and disaster recovery capabilities, with application scenarios including data migration, scalable application deployment, and enterprise digital transformation.

Core components include API gateways, containerization platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), secure network connections (VPN or dedicated lines), data synchronization tools (e.g., Apache Kafka), and unified monitoring systems. Features involve seamless interoperability, automatic scaling, and unified policy management, with principles based on cloud-native architecture to enable cross-environment deployment. In practical applications, enterprises can deploy critical workloads in a hybrid manner, such as processing sensitive data on-premises and running big data analytics in the cloud, thereby improving resource utilization, innovation capabilities, and overall efficiency.

Implementation steps include: 1) Assessing existing infrastructure and requirements; 2) Selecting multi-cloud vendors and deploying container platforms like Kubernetes; 3) Establishing network integration using VPN or cloud service tools; 4) Applying CI/CD pipelines to achieve code portability; 5) Configuring security policies and monitoring tools. Typical scenarios include cross-environment disaster recovery or elastic service scaling. Business value includes cost reduction, improved business agility, optimized risk management, and accelerated time-to-market.
