  "content": "In the CI/CD pipeline, security and compliance checks refer to the automated integration of security controls to assess vulnerabilities in code and infrastructure, as well as regulatory compliance (such as GDPR or PCI DSS). This is crucial because it prevents data breaches and non-compliance risks, and is applied throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure security and reliability at every stage from code commit to deployment.\n\nThe core components include Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), dependency scanning, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) validation. The principle is that tools are integrated into the pipeline to set gatekeeping conditions, enabling early detection. In practical applications, this promotes \"\"shifting security left\"\", improves DevOps efficiency, reduces late-stage remediation costs, and ensures smooth compliance audits.\n\nFor implementation: Define security policies, integrate tools like SonarQube or Snyk to automatically perform scans during the build phase; set gatekeeping review failure points; and continuously monitor reports. Business values include reducing non-compliance fines, enhancing product credibility and team accountability, with typical scenarios such as automated scans completing checks before code merging."
