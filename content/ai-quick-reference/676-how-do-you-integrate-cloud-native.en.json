  "content": "Cloud-native data management leverages technologies such as containerization and Kubernetes to optimize data storage and analysis in the cloud; its importance lies in enhancing scalability and efficiency, enabling integration with on-premises systems, and supporting hybrid cloud applications like data migration and real-time processing.\n\nThe core components include data gateways, unified API interfaces, and synchronization tools, characterized by automation and high availability, and in principle bridging resources through middleware; practical applications include disaster recovery and cross-platform analysis, significantly reducing operational costs and accelerating digital transformation.\n\nImplementation steps: Assess data dependencies; deploy replication tools such as CDC or Apache Kafka; achieve API integration through containerized services; strengthen security measures; and finally test and monitor. Typical scenarios involve hybrid database management; business values include cost optimization, elastic scaling, and enhanced data consistency."
