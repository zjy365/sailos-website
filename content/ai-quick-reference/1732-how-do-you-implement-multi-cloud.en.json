  "content": "As a core IaC tool, Terraform is key to implementing a multi-cloud Infrastructure as Code (IaC) strategy. It defines and manages resources across multiple cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP through declarative configurations. Implementing this strategy is crucial for avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing business resilience and disaster recovery capabilities, optimizing costs, and simplifying the governance of complex environments. Application scenarios include hybrid cloud deployment, disaster recovery solutions, and multi-region distribution.\n\nThe core of implementation lies in modular design and state management. The main steps include: 1. Define multiple cloud providers: Declare and configure target cloud service provider authentication in the configuration; 2. Utilize modules to encapsulate resources: Create reusable modules to abstract common infrastructure patterns; 3. Isolate environments with workspaces or directories: Differentiate configurations for development, testing, and production environments, and manage variables using `.tfvars` files; 4. Integrate version control and CI/CD: Automate deployment processes through GitOps practices (such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and securely store state files in a remote backend.\n\nThis strategy delivers significant business value: standardizing processes and unifying cloud resource deployment specifications; enhancing consistency and reducing the risk of configuration drift; improving efficiency by automating cross-cloud deployments; optimizing costs by enabling unified monitoring and governance of cloud expenditures; and strengthening compliance by auditing infrastructure policies through code. Key toolchains include Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, Vault (key management), and Sentinel (policy as code)."
