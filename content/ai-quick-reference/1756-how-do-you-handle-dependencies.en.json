  "content": "In multi-cloud Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments, dependencies refer to the requirements for the deployment order of components, such as a database starting before an application. Their importance lies in ensuring reliable resource configuration and avoiding sequencing errors, with application scenarios including cross-cloud Kubernetes services or microservice deployments.\n\nThe core components involve the dependency management features of IaC tools (e.g., Terraform), including dependency graph resolution mechanisms. The characteristics are declarative definition and automated sequence processing. In practical applications, after defining resource dependencies, the deployment is automatically ordered, significantly improving consistency and scalability across multiple environments.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Explicitly declare dependencies in the IaC code. 2. Use tools to execute dependency graph-driven sequential deployment. 3. Verify dependency satisfaction through continuous monitoring. A typical scenario is cross-cloud region database startup, with business values including reduced downtime and enhanced deployment repeatability."
