  "content": "Microservices are a set of independent, loosely coupled small services; Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) enables asynchronous communication through publishing and subscribing to events, improving system scalability, resilience, and response speed, suitable for scenarios such as e-commerce order processing and real-time analytics.\n\nThe core components of EDA include event producers (services that publish events), message brokers (such as Kafka for storing event streams), and event consumers (services that process events). The principle is that asynchronous event streams ensure loose coupling and eventual consistency; integrating EDA into microservices supports real-time applications such as order status updates, enhancing fault tolerance and business agility.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Decompose microservices and define event schemas (e.g., order creation); 2. Integrate producer/consumer logic into services; 3. Deploy message queues (e.g., Kafka); 4. Implement idempotent operations to handle errors. Typical scenarios include inventory management, and business values include enhanced system resilience, support for high-throughput asynchronous processing, and ease of scalability and maintenance."
