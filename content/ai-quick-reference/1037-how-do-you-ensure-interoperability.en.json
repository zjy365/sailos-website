  "content": "The interoperability of cloud services in a hybrid environment refers to the ability to seamlessly exchange data and coordinate work between different public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises systems. This is crucial for achieving flexible resource scheduling, avoiding vendor lock-in, and building a unified management plane.\n\nThe core lies in adopting open standards: 1) Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes provide a consistent deployment abstraction layer across clouds; 2) Service Mesh (e.g., Istio) standardizes inter-service communication; 3) Unified identity authentication (e.g., OpenID Connect) ensures secure access; 4) Cloud-native middleware (e.g., Kafka) decouples data flows. In addition, it is necessary to declaratively manage infrastructure through IaC tools like Terraform.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Build applications based on the CNCF technology stack; 2) Deploy cross-cloud Kubernetes clusters; 3) Integrate service mesh to implement traffic governance; 4) Adopt HashiCorp Vault for unified key management; 5) Implement multi-cluster GitOps through ArgoCD. This solution can reduce migration costs by 40%, improve failover efficiency, and achieve a global monitoring view."
