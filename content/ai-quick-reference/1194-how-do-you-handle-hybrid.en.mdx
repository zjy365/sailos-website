Hybrid cloud deployment integrates the scalability of public clouds with the dedicated control resources of private clouds, applied to mission-critical applications to ensure high availability, low latency, and security compliance. The importance of this strategy lies in meeting strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs), responding to disaster scenarios, and addressing data sovereignty requirements, commonly used in high-risk industries such as finance and healthcare.

Core components include public cloud services (e.g., AWS), private data centers, unified network connectivity (e.g., VPN), and container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes). Features encompass elastic scaling, data replication, and automated failover principles. In practical applications, it supports continuous business operations, enables cross-regional load balancing and disaster recovery, and significantly enhances resilience and resource utilization.

Implementation steps: After evaluating workload requirements, deploy cross-cloud container clusters via Kubernetes and configure strategies such as blue-green deployment for rolling updates. Typical scenarios include CI/CD pipelines and elastic scaling. Business value includes reducing downtime risks, optimizing cost efficiency, accelerating innovation iterations, supporting the reliable operation of critical applications, and gaining competitive advantages.
