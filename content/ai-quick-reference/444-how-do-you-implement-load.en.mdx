Load balancing in a microservices environment refers to the technology of evenly distributing requests among multiple service instances to ensure high availability and performance improvement. Its importance lies in handling the dynamic nature and high concurrency of microservices, avoiding single points of failure, and enhancing resilience. Application scenarios include cloud-native platforms such as Kubernetes and containerized deployments.

Core components include service discovery (e.g., Consul or Eureka) and routing algorithms (e.g., round-robin or least connections). Features involve health checks to dynamically update instance status and intelligent traffic distribution. This improves scalability and supports fault tolerance, enabling seamless service communication and resource optimization in microservice architectures.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy a service registry to automatically discover instances. 2. Configure a load balancer (e.g., Kubernetes Service). 3. Integrate health monitoring and auto-scaling policies. Typical scenarios include Kubernetes Ingress handling traffic between Pods, bringing business values such as reduced latency, maximized resource efficiency, and improved system resilience.
