  "content": "Centralized logging is the process of aggregating scattered logs into a single platform. It is crucial in microservice-based systems because independently deployed services require unified monitoring to support debugging, security auditing, and performance optimization. When applied to Kubernetes or cloud-native environments, it simplifies cross-service problem diagnosis.\n\nCore components include log collection agents (such as Fluentd or Fluent Bit), central storage (such as Elasticsearch or Loki), and visualization tools (such as Kibana or Grafana). The principle involves collecting, parsing, and indexing logs into queryable data. In practical applications, it improves operational efficiency, reduces cross-service fault location time to the minute level, and enhances system observability.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy lightweight agents in microservice containers to collect logs; 2. Configure an aggregation layer like Fluentd to aggregate data; 3. Set up storage such as Elasticsearch to ensure persistence; 4. Integrate visualization tools for monitoring. A typical scenario is using the EFK stack in Kubernetes. The business value lies in simplifying operations, reducing MTTR, and enhancing compliance."
