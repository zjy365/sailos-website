  "content": "In cloud-native environments, security measures target the dynamic characteristics of containerization and microservice architectures to ensure the security of data and applications in distributed systems. Their importance lies in preventing data leaks and attack vulnerabilities. Application scenarios such as Kubernetes clusters and public cloud platforms require the protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nCore measures include identity and access management (e.g., RBAC), network policies (e.g., the zero-trust model of service meshes), secret management, container image scanning, and runtime monitoring. These features are integrated into DevSecOps processes, reducing the attack surface and supporting compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR) through automated vulnerability detection and security auditing, thereby enhancing the overall defense capabilities of the cloud-native ecosystem.\n\nThe application value of major security measures lies in enhancing system resilience, ensuring data privacy, and seamlessly integrating security throughout the entire lifecycle from deployment to production, achieving a balance between business agility and compliance. For example, implementing image scanning can prevent supply chain attacks, with values including risk reduction, increased credibility, and promotion of innovation."
