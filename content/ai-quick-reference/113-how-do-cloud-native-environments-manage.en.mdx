Cloud-native environments achieve automated resource allocation through containerization and orchestration systems (such as Kubernetes), enhancing the scalability and efficiency of development teams. They are suitable for agile application scenarios like microservices, ensuring high resource utilization and rapid deployment.

Its core includes resource quota management, namespace isolation, and auto-scaling features (such as HPA). By setting CPU/memory limits through tools, it ensures fair resource allocation among teams. In practical applications, it reduces manual intervention, improves operational efficiency, and significantly reduces resource waste and deployment bottlenecks.

Team implementation steps include: dividing namespaces to isolate resources, setting Pod resource quota requests and limits, and configuring auto-scaling to dynamically adjust based on load. Typical scenarios include applications with traffic fluctuations, and business values involve cost optimization, avoiding contention risks, and accelerating the innovation cycle.
