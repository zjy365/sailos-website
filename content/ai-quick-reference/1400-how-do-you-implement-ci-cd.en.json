  "content": "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates software build, testing, and release processes, which are crucial in cloud-native multi-service applications. It accelerates iteration, reduces errors, and supports independent deployment of microservice architectures, such as efficient operation and maintenance in Kubernetes environments.\n\nThe core components include version control (Git), CI servers (e.g., Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD), containerization tools (Docker), and orchestration platforms (Kubernetes). The principle is to automate testing, build images, and deployment declarations through pipelines, supporting service isolation and dependency management, and improving observability and elasticity.\n\nImplementation steps: Configure the code repository to trigger the pipeline and integrate unit tests; build container images and push them to the registry; deploy Kubernetes manifests using Kubectl or Argo CD. Typical scenarios include rolling updates of services. Business value: Shorten the release cycle by more than 50%, enhance system stability and team collaboration efficiency."
