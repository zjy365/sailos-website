Data recovery in cloud-native applications refers to ensuring data availability after failures through strategies and tools, which is crucial for maintaining business continuity and high availability, especially in microservice architectures such as e-commerce or financial service scenarios. Its core practices include scheduled backups using object storage, integrating persistent volumes (PV/PVC) to ensure data persistence, and implementing automated cluster backup and recovery with tools like Velero; practical applications can shorten the Recovery Time Objective (RTO), enhance system resilience, and support multi-region disaster recovery. The application value is reflected in quickly restoring services, minimizing data loss, ensuring compliance, thereby improving business reliability and customer trust.
