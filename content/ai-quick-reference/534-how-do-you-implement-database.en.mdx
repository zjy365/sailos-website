Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique that distributes data across multiple database instances to improve performance and scalability. It is crucial in microservices architecture for handling high concurrent traffic and data growth, commonly seen in large-scale application scenarios such as e-commerce or social media.

The core components include the selection of a shard key (e.g., based on user ID), sharding strategy (e.g., hash or range), and data routing mechanism. In practical applications, each microservice manages its own database shards, and queries are processed through proxies or middleware to enhance system throughput; however, this increases the complexity of distributed transactions.

Implementation steps: select a shard key; design a strategy (e.g., hash sharding); deploy multiple shard instances; integrate a routing layer (e.g., ShardingSphere); handle consistency (via the Saga pattern). A typical scenario is high-growth services, bringing business values such as enhanced scalability and reduced latency.
