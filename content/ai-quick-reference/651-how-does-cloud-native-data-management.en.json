  "content": "Cloud-native data management efficiently handles application data in cloud environments through containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and distributed storage technologies to support elastic resource allocation. It is crucial for ensuring application scalability, suitable for e-commerce peak processing and real-time analytics scenarios, enabling agile response to load changes and reducing operational costs.\n\nCore components include distributed databases (e.g., Cassandra), persistent volumes, and container orchestration mechanisms (e.g., Horizontal Pod Autoscaler). Its principles are based on declarative APIs and automated scheduling to achieve dynamic resource scaling and fault recovery. In practical applications, this management method promotes the stable operation of applications under high concurrency, improves resource utilization, and drives the popularization of cloud-native architecture, with impacts covering financial risk control and high-traffic service platforms.\n\nImplementation steps include: first, containerizing application components to deploy data services; second, integrating cloud-native databases such as Amazon RDS; third, configuring Kubernetes auto-scaling policies; fourth, implementing data backup and replication mechanisms. A typical scenario is coping with traffic peaks, and the business value is reflected in reducing latency, enhancing user experience, supporting rapid business growth, and saving IT expenses."
