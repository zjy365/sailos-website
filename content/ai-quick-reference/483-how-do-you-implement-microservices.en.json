  "content": "Microservices testing verifies the functionality and integration of individual services through automated tools to ensure the reliability of distributed systems, suitable for the development of cloud-native applications with high-frequency iterations.\n\nIts core includes API testing, contract testing, and unit testing, characterized by automated execution and reliance on simulation tools based on continuous integration principles. In practical applications, it improves coverage, with the impact of reducing defects and accelerating the release cycle.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Select tools such as Postman or JUnit. 2. Write test scripts to define service behaviors. 3. Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for continuous verification. A typical scenario is new service development, with business value in shortening time-to-market and enhancing system stability."
