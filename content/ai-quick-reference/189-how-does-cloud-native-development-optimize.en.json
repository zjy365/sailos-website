  "content": "Cloud-native development optimizes large-scale application deployment through core technologies such as containerization, microservices, continuous delivery, and dynamic orchestration. Its core value lies in improving deployment efficiency, reliability, and elasticity to meet the rapid iteration requirements of large-scale, highly complex applications.\n\nCore optimization strategies include: 1) Microservice architecture decouples applications to enable independent deployment and scaling; 2) Kubernetes orchestration automates container scheduling, Rolling Updates, and blue-green/canary releases to reduce release risks; 3) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) unifies environment configurations; 4) CI/CD pipelines enable automated testing and deployment to accelerate iteration.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Containerize application components; 2) Adopt microservices to split business logic; 3) Configure Kubernetes deployment strategies (e.g., ReplicaSets, HPA); 4) Establish CI/CD for automated build and testing; 5) Implement progressive release monitoring. Business values include reducing release cycles from days to minutes, significantly decreasing mean time to recovery (MTTR), and improving resource utilization by over 30%."
