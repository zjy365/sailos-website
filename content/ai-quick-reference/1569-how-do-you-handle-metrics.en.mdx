Metric sampling refers to a key technology in cloud-native observability systems that selectively collects metric data points to reduce data volume and costs. Its importance lies in handling high-throughput data streams generated by microservice architectures, preventing resource overload, and is applied in Kubernetes cluster monitoring and distributed performance analysis scenarios.

Core components include sampling strategies such as random sampling, time-series sampling, or adaptive algorithms, which adjust data collection frequency based on rules. Features encompass data denoising, storage optimization, and high-throughput processing to ensure observability accuracy. In practical applications, tools like Prometheus support configuration sampling, improving system scalability and reducing operational costs, thereby enhancing real-time insights into service health status.

The steps for handling metric sampling are: first, define key metrics and sampling strategies; second, configure the sampling rate at the agent layer such as Prometheus; finally, deploy and monitor the results for continuous optimization. Typical scenarios are used in real-time monitoring systems, and business values include reducing storage expenses, ensuring coverage of key metrics, and supporting efficient troubleshooting.
