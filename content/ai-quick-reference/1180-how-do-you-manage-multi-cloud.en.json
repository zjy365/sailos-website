  "content": "Cloud-native application multi-cloud API integration management coordinates service interfaces of multiple cloud platforms (such as computing or storage APIs), ensuring high availability, portability, and avoiding vendor lock-in, suitable for financial or global deployment scenarios.\n\nCore components include API gateways (e.g., Kong) and service meshes (e.g., Istio), enabling cross-cloud communication through dynamic routing, security mechanisms (e.g., OAuth or TLS), and load balancing. In practical applications, it facilitates failover and service discovery, enhances system resilience, and influences hybrid cloud strategies to optimize cost and performance.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Deploy an API management platform as a unified entry point. 2) Define policies including authentication and rate limiting. 3) Use service mesh to route traffic. 4) Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus). Typical scenarios involve cross-AWS/Azure API calls, with business values of accelerating innovation, enhancing scalability, and reducing risks."
