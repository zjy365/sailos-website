  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates the management of cloud resources through declarative configurations, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and version control. It is crucial for the auto-scaling of cloud-native resources as it eliminates manual operations and enables dynamic responses to load changes, such as the elastic adjustment of Pod quantities in Kubernetes clusters. Application scenarios include handling traffic during e-commerce peak periods and optimizing resources in microservice architectures.\n\nThe core components include IaC templates that define scaling rules (e.g., Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration files), monitoring metrics (e.g., CPU or memory usage thresholds), and automated triggering mechanisms. The principle is to automatically adjust resource scale based on real-time data feedback. In practical applications, it enables on-demand scaling and shrinking of resources, significantly improving system elasticity, reducing operational burden, and minimizing cloud cost waste.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Write auto-scaling configurations in IaC tools (e.g., Terraform), specifying metric thresholds and target resources. 2. Deploy the configurations to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS or Google Kubernetes Engine). 3. Test and validate the scaling logic and continuously monitor metrics. Typical scenarios involve automatically scaling Pods during e-commerce promotions to maintain performance; business values include optimizing resource utilization, improving application availability, and saving operational costs by up to 30%."
