  "content": "IaC scripts are used to automate infrastructure deployment, managing resource limits (such as CPU and memory) and quotas (such as the maximum number of instances) through code to ensure efficient resource utilization, avoid overspending, and enhance security. This is particularly important in Kubernetes and cloud-native environments, supporting elastic scaling and cost control, and is suitable for public cloud and containerized deployments.\n\nKey components include declaring resource quotas in Terraform or Ansible scripts (for example, using `resource \"\"aws_instance\"\"` to set instance types and count limits) and integrating environment variables or policy files to enforce constraints. In practical applications, defining Kubernetes resource requests and limits can prevent Pod crashes; automating verification through version control and CI/CD pipelines improves configuration consistency and compliance.\n\nImplementation steps: First, analyze the quota requirements of the cloud provider; second, add limit variables in the IaC script (such as setting the maximum memory value); finally, test the deployment and use monitoring tools to audit resource usage. Business values include reducing waste, preventing service disruptions, and optimizing costs and operational efficiency through automation."
