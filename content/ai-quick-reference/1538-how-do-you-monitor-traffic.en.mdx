Monitoring traffic between different Kubernetes clusters involves tracking and visualizing inter-cluster network communication data, which is crucial for multi-cluster deployments to ensure the reliability, security, and performance optimization of cross-environment communication. It is commonly used in multi-cloud architectures and microservice scaling scenarios to support high availability and global traffic management.

Core components include service meshes (such as Istio or Linkerd), which are injected into Pods through Envoy proxies to enable cross-cluster traffic routing, encryption, and metrics collection. Metrics tools like Prometheus combined with Fluentd log aggregation, along with Grafana visualization dashboards, provide real-time traffic analysis, latency detection, and security policy enforcement. Practical applications cover API call and data synchronization monitoring, with impacts including improved system resilience and reduced network bottlenecks.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy a shared service mesh (e.g., Istio multi-cluster model) and install monitoring agents. 2. Integrate Prometheus to scrape cross-cluster metrics and configure Grafana dashboards. 3. Set up network policies (e.g., NetworkPolicy and mTLS). Typical scenario: Cloud-native application operation and maintenance, with business values including rapid fault localization, performance optimization, and compliance assurance.
