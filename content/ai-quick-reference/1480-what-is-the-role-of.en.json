  "content": "Service discovery is a mechanism for dynamically locating and managing the positions (such as IP and port) of service instances in distributed systems, and it is crucial in observability. It solves the problem of constantly changing network endpoints caused by dynamic scaling, failures, or rolling updates of instances in cloud-native environments (e.g., microservices and Kubernetes). Service discovery automatically maintains a service registry, providing real-time and accurate service endpoint information for observability tools, making system status visible and enabling effective monitoring, alerting, and diagnosis.\n\nThe core components of service discovery typically include a service registry (e.g., etcd, Consul, Nacos), service providers (registering instances), and service consumers (querying the registry). The principle is that when a service starts, it registers metadata (including health status) with the registry, and service consumers or observability tools obtain the list of currently available instances by querying the registry. This dynamic mechanism is the foundation for understanding dependencies between services and traffic topology.\n\nIn observability, service discovery provides key information for context correlation: by automatically associating services and instance metadata (service name, version, tags, etc.) on the request chain with Metrics, Logs, and Traces data, observability data has a clear service dimension. This enables faster and more accurate problem location (e.g., quickly finding fault points by correlating service topology), more effective performance analysis (locating bottlenecks of specific services), avoids monitoring \"\"blind spots\"\" caused by service dynamics, and greatly improves the efficiency and value of system observability."
