Implementing test automation in CI/CD pipelines involves automatically executing test scripts through a toolchain to verify quality immediately after code submission. Its importance lies in providing rapid feedback on defects, reducing manual costs, and ensuring deployment reliability, making it suitable for high-frequency release cloud-native application scenarios.

Core components include unit testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit/Pytest), integration testing tools (e.g., Testcontainers), and end-to-end testing tools (e.g., Selenium). A key feature is the test stratification strategy: in the pipeline, unit tests (build phase), integration tests (pre-release environment), and UI tests (production-like environment) are executed in sequence. Automated testing directly impacts the efficiency of deployment decisions through continuous quality gates.

Implementation steps are: 1. Select a test framework matching the language and write scripts; 2. Containerize the test environment to ensure consistency; 3. Configure the test stage in Jenkins/GitLab CI, such as adding `stage('Test')` to execute test commands; 4. Integrate test reporting tools (e.g., Allure). Typical business values include a 40% reduction in release cycles (reducing manual verification) and a 60% decrease in defect escape rate.
