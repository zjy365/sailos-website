  "content": "First paragraph:\n\nIn CI/CD pipelines, the management of keys and secrets (such as API keys, database credentials, and certificates) is crucial to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or leakage. A secure management mechanism is the foundation for ensuring the security and compliance of the software supply chain, applied in all stages of automated building, testing, and deployment.\n\nSecond paragraph:\n\nThe core is to use dedicated secret management tools (e.g., Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager) or platform-native solutions (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets). Features include centralized storage, strict access control (based on RBAC), encryption in transit/storage (both at rest and in motion), automatic rotation, and audit logs. This avoids hardcoding plaintext in code repositories or pipeline scripts and securely delivers secrets to the runtime environment via API or file injection.\n\nThird paragraph:\n\nImplementation steps: Evaluate and select appropriate tools; centrally store all secrets in the tool; configure least-privilege access for CI/CD systems and service accounts; dynamically retrieve secrets during pipeline execution via secure APIs (to avoid logging); integrate automatic rotation mechanisms; conduct regular audits. This significantly reduces the risk of credential leakage, ensures the security of production environments, enhances compliance, and supports a zero-trust architecture."
