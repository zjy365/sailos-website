Cloud security strategy refers to a key method of coordinating security measures across multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). It is crucial in multi-cloud environments to prevent data breaches and meet compliance requirements, and is commonly used in enterprise scenarios where applications are deployed across clouds.

The core components include unified identity management (such as IAM and MFA), data encryption, network security isolation, and continuous monitoring and auditing. These are based on the principle of least privilege and the zero-trust model. In practical applications, enterprises integrate Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools to detect cross-cloud threats in real time and enhance overall protection.

Effective implementation steps are: 1. Assess cloud asset risks; 2. Deploy unified identity policies and strengthen access controls; 3. Set up network segmentation and firewall rules; 4. Enable data encryption and log monitoring; 5. Regularly audit and update policies. Typically used in hybrid cloud deployment scenarios, its value includes reducing accident rates, ensuring GDPR compliance, and optimizing security costs.
