Cloud-native environments implement elastic and scalable applications based on containerization and microservices. Data leakage refers to unauthorized access to sensitive information. Its importance lies in protecting data privacy in distributed systems, ensuring compliance, and maintaining business continuity. Application scenarios include cloud-native applications such as Kubernetes clusters deployed in hybrid cloud environments.

The core components include least privilege access control, end-to-end encryption, network isolation, and service mesh policies. A zero-trust architecture is implemented to reduce the attack surface. In practical applications, role authorization is strengthened through Kubernetes RBAC, service meshes like Istio are used to ensure secure communication between services, and audit logs are combined to monitor anomalies, thereby enhancing the overall security posture and compliance.

Implementation steps include auditing configuration risks, deploying strong authentication mechanisms, encrypting data at rest and in transit, setting network policies to restrict traffic, and using tools such as OPA to enforce policies. A typical scenario involves integrating key management services in Kubernetes clusters. Business values include reducing the probability of leakage, meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR, maintaining customer trust, and reducing the risk of business losses.
