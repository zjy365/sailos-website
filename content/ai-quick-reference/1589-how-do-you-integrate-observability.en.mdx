Observability refers to the ability to monitor system status through logs, metrics, and traces. When combined with a hybrid cloud strategy, it ensures unified monitoring across public and private cloud environments. Its importance lies in enhancing reliability, optimizing resource utilization, and supporting complex application deployments, such as cross-cloud migration and disaster recovery scenarios.

The core components include log collection, performance metrics, and distributed tracing. Its features are centralized management, real-time alerts, and data standardization (e.g., OpenTelemetry). In practical applications, it enables cross-environment fault location, performance analysis, and root cause diagnosis, improving operational efficiency by 50% while reducing management complexity and ensuring business continuity.

Implementation steps are: select compatible tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana); deploy agents on all hybrid nodes; standardize data formats; configure centralized storage and analysis; set up customized alerts. Typical scenarios include container monitoring and dynamic scaling, bringing values such as 30% reduction in response time, cost optimization, and improved user satisfaction.
