Integrating compliance checks into cloud-native CI/CD pipelines refers to systematically embedding automated verification of security policies, configuration standards, and regulatory requirements into the automated software build, testing, and deployment processes. Its importance lies in ensuring that cloud-native applications (such as containerized microservices) meet internal policies (e.g., image security) and external regulations (e.g., GDPR) from the start of development, which is a key practice for implementing DevSecOps, reducing risks, and accelerating compliant go-live.

Core components include: 1) Compliance toolchain integration: Embedding OSS compliance scanning tools at different pipeline stages (e.g., Checkov for IaC security checks, Trivy for image CVE scanning, OPA for deployment policy validation); 2) Policy as code: Defining a compliance rule library (e.g., K8s resource limits, service exposure rules) using a unified language (e.g., Rego); 3) Automated blocking and feedback: Blocking non-compliant images during the CI build phase and rejecting non-compliant changes via admission controllers (e.g., OPA Gatekeeper) before CD deployment; 4) Continuous auditing and reporting: Automatically generating compliance evidence reports for auditing. This directly impacts the application's security baseline and audit efficiency.

Implementation steps:

1. Shift-left strategy: Conduct initial compliance checks during the development phase via IDE plugins/pre-commit hooks.

2. CI phase control:

- Post-build: Scan container images (Trivy/Crowdstrike)

- IaC validation: Scan K8s manifests/Terraform code with Checkov/Terrascan

3. CD phase control:

- Pre-deployment: Validate K8s resource compliance via OPA Gatekeeper

- Pre-environment deployment: Execute policy tests (e.g., Kyverno)

4. Feedback and blocking: The pipeline automatically interrupts non-compliant processes and notifies responsible persons, allowing only compliant builds to proceed to subsequent stages. The value lies in achieving continuous compliance assurance, significantly reducing remediation costs and audit risks.
