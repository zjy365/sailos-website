  "content": "IaC tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation automate infrastructure management through code, and auto-scaling enables applications to dynamically adjust resources (such as the number of instances) based on load. Their importance includes improving elasticity, optimizing costs, and ensuring high availability. Application scenarios cover cloud-native deployments and microservice architectures, especially in e-commerce or real-time services with large traffic fluctuations.\n\nThe core components involve defining scaling policies (such as CPU utilization thresholds), resource groups (such as Auto Scaling Groups or Kubernetes' HPA), and integrating monitoring (such as Prometheus). The principle is to trigger automatic scaling based on rules, and the actual application is manifested in scaling EC2 instances on AWS or adjusting the number of Pod replicas in K8s, which improves system reliability, reduces manual intervention, and supports agile deployment.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define resources with IaC scripts (such as declaring instance ranges and metrics). 2. Set scaling policies (such as minimum/maximum instances and trigger conditions). 3. Deploy to CI/CD pipeline to monitor execution. A typical scenario is web application deployment, and the business value includes reducing costs, enhancing performance, and quickly responding to peak demand."
