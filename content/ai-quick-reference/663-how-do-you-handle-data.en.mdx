Data migration between cloud service providers refers to the process of transferring data from one cloud platform to another, such as from AWS to Azure. This is crucial for implementing a multi-cloud strategy, avoiding vendor lock-in, and ensuring business continuity. Application scenarios include cost optimization, compliance migration, or disaster recovery, helping enterprises enhance resilience in a dynamic environment.

Core components involve migration tools, security protocols, and data validation mechanisms. Features include cross-cloud compatibility, incremental synchronization, and error handling. In practical applications, using cloud-native services like Azure Data Factory or AWS Snowball allows enterprises to achieve efficient bulk migration, reducing downtime and ensuring data integrity.

Processing steps include evaluating data sources and capacity; selecting appropriate tools and configuring network security; performing phased migration and validation testing. Typical scenarios, such as transferring object storage data, bring the value of reducing migration costs and improving business agility.
