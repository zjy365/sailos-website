Microservices architecture is a software design paradigm that decomposes an application into small, independent services, with the key goal of enhancing agility and scalability. Its importance lies in supporting parallel development and rapid iteration, making it suitable for distributed systems requiring frequent updates, such as e-commerce platforms and real-time streaming services.

Core features include service autonomy, independent deployment, and API communication, with each service developed by a dedicated team. In practical applications, it promotes team collaboration freedom, reduces code conflicts, and accelerates feature development through technological diversity, significantly shortening the development cycle.

Achieving faster development cycles is accomplished through parallel team work and automated pipelines. Steps include dividing service boundaries, implementing CI/CD, and continuous deployment, with typical scenarios in agile enterprise environments. This brings business value such as shortening delivery time by weeks and enabling rapid response to market changes.
