Cloud-native environments utilize containerization, microservices, and cloud infrastructure to enhance disaster recovery capabilities and ensure business continuity. Their importance lies in defending against disasters such as hardware failures or regional outages, making them suitable for high-availability scenarios like financial services and e-commerce.

Their core includes automated disaster recovery strategies, such as high-availability replication of Kubernetes clusters, multi-regional data persistence, and real-time monitoring and alerting. Features are reflected in elastic scaling and self-healing capabilities. Practical applications shorten the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and improve system resilience.

Implementation steps: Design a cross-regional cluster architecture, integrate tools such as Velero backup service and Istio service mesh to achieve automatic failover. Business value: Significantly reduce downtime losses and meet compliance requirements.
