In the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflow, key rotation and management involve securely handling sensitive data such as API keys or certificates, avoiding hardcoding and manual intervention. Its importance lies in enhancing security, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches, and ensuring compliance especially in cloud deployments and automated CI/CD pipelines.

Core components include the use of key management services (such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager), combined with automated rotation strategies like regular updates and audit logs. Features涵盖加密存储、最小权限原则和版本控制, in practical applications, it is integrated into IaC tools (such as Terraform) to achieve seamless updates without redeployment, thereby reducing operational risks.

Implementation steps: first, select a secure key storage; then dynamically reference keys in IaC code instead of plaintext; next, set up定时触发器to automatically generate new keys; finally, monitor changes and audit logs. Typical scenarios include cloud resource configuration and microservice architectures, with business values including reducing security vulnerabilities, strengthening compliance, and optimizing operational efficiency.
