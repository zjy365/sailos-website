  "content": "Cloud-native storage is a data management solution designed for cloud-native applications. It realizes dynamic, scalable, and persistent functions by abstracting storage resources. Its importance lies in ensuring data availability, elastic expansion, and fault recovery for large-scale applications. Application scenarios include containerized environments under microservice architecture, such as AI/ML workloads or distributed databases in Kubernetes clusters.\n\nIts core components include Persistent Volume (PV), Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), StorageClass, and Container Storage Interface (CSI). Features include automatic provisioning, elastic scaling, data redundancy, and snapshot backup. The principle is based on a standardized CSI plugin mechanism, which seamlessly integrates with cloud provider storage services such as AWS EBS or Azure Disk. In practical applications, it simplifies storage lifecycle management, improves resource utilization, and supports multi-tenant isolation.\n\nImplementation steps include: first, defining a StorageClass to specify the storage type (such as SSD or HDD); then, the application requests the required capacity through a PVC; Kubernetes dynamically binds and creates a PV; finally, using the CSI plugin to implement storage mounting. A typical scenario is a streaming media platform processing PB-level data. The business value is reducing operational complexity, achieving on-demand resource consumption, and ensuring high SLA."
