Automatically implementing security patches in CI/CD pipelines is a key practice for promptly deploying vulnerability fixes to production environments through automated processes. It can significantly reduce security risks and human errors, and is particularly suitable for cloud-native applications and containerized environments (such as Kubernetes). This solution ensures rapid response to zero-day vulnerabilities, meets compliance requirements, and guarantees continuous system security.

The core implementation includes: 1) Integrating security scanning tools (such as Trivy, Clair) into the CI phase to automatically detect image vulnerabilities; 2) Configuring automatic trigger rules in the pipeline to initiate the update process when high-risk vulnerabilities or new patches are discovered; 3) Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to update the base image version; 4) Introducing canary release or blue-green deployment strategies to verify patch compatibility in the pre-release environment; 5) Implementing version control and audit tracking in combination with GitOps.

Typical implementation steps: 1) Trigger vulnerability scanning in the CI phase to screen CVEs requiring urgent patching; 2) Automatically create a patch branch and update the base image tag in the Dockerfile or Helm Chart; 3) Build a new image and push it to the artifact repository, and complete signature verification; 4) Automatically deploy to the test/pre-release cluster in the CD phase and run integration tests; 5) Deploy the patch to the production environment through a progressive delivery strategy, and automatically roll back services with test failures or monitoring abnormalities.
