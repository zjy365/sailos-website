End-to-end testing is a testing method that verifies the overall functionality of an application by simulating real user flows. In CI/CD, it ensures that integrated changes do not affect core business logic, and is particularly suitable for risk prevention in web applications and microservice architectures.

Its core involves automated test scripts, environment management (such as containerized deployment), and testing frameworks like Selenium. After integration, it runs in real-time in the pipeline, facilitating automatic defect detection and reporting, improving software reliability and team efficiency, and reducing production failures.

Implementation steps: select a framework (e.g., Playwright), add a testing phase in CI/CD tools (e.g., GitLab CI); configure environment variables; define the script execution order; automatically process test results, and decide on deployment through threshold monitoring. A typical scenario is in high-frequency deployment projects, enabling rapid feedback and increased release confidence.
