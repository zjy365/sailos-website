Cloud-native development is a modern software development approach based on cloud computing and containerization technologies, focusing on building resilient and scalable applications. Its importance lies in shortening time-to-market through automated deployment and elastic resource management, making it suitable for scenarios requiring rapid iteration such as e-commerce platforms and financial systems.

The core components include microservices architecture that decomposes applications into independent modules, containerization (e.g., Docker) to encapsulate environmental dependencies, Kubernetes orchestration for automatic scaling and fault recovery, and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Practical applications like DevOps collaboration have improved development efficiency, with impacts including reducing release cycles from months to days and lowering operational costs.

Implementation steps involve decomposing applications into microservices, containerizing packages, integrating CI/CD tools for automated building and testing, and utilizing cloud platform elastic scaling resources. Typical scenarios such as A/B testing accelerate validation, and the business value is to speed up innovation in response to market changes, enhance competitive advantages, and improve user satisfaction.
