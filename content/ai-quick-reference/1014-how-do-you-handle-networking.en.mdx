A multi-cloud environment refers to the combination of multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). Network issues involve challenges like cross-cloud interconnection, latency, and security. Its importance lies in ensuring business continuity, high availability, and flexible scalability, applicable to scenarios such as hybrid deployments and disaster recovery, to optimize resources and avoid vendor lock-in.

The core components include SD-WAN tools, multi-cloud management platforms (such as Google Anthos), and service meshes (such as Istio), enabling unified traffic management, policy control, and API-driven automation. Features include dynamic routing, security isolation, and load balancing. In practical applications, cloud-native technologies are used to integrate CI/CD pipelines to improve application performance; the impact is reducing operational complexity and enhancing global coverage resilience.

Implementation steps: 1. Assess requirements, such as bandwidth and compliance requirements; 2. Deploy VPN or direct interconnection (such as cloud exchange); 3. Adopt monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) for continuous optimization. Typical scenarios include distributed data synchronization or microservices architecture. Business value: reduce latency risks, improve cost-effectiveness, and support multi-region compliance.
