CI/CD pipeline is a key practice for implementing continuous integration and deployment of software, automating development processes to improve efficiency. API integration testing verifies the correctness of API interactions within a system, which is crucial in microservices or cloud-native architectures, ensuring component compatibility and rapid iteration to support efficient release of new features.

The core includes designing automated test scripts, using tools such as Postman or RestAssured to simulate API calls and verify response data, status codes, and exception handling. Features cover end-to-end testing to simulate external dependencies and detect interface errors early. Its application reduces production failures, enhances system reliability, and is suitable for integration scenarios of RESTful APIs with backends or third-party services.

Implementation steps: 1. Configure the test framework in CI/CD tools. 2. Develop API test cases covering different scenarios. 3. Automatically execute tests during the build or deployment phase. 4. Block problematic deployments through failure feedback. Typical scenarios include testing the integration of new API versions, and its business value lies in reducing manual verification burden, accelerating delivery, and ensuring quality consistency.
