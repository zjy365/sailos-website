Microservice configuration management refers to the unified maintenance of differential settings (such as database connection strings, feature toggles) for services in different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) to ensure environmental isolation and security. Its core importance lies in avoiding hard-coded configurations, achieving environment-agnostic deployment packages, and supporting continuous delivery and elastic scaling. Typical scenarios include multi-cluster deployment, cross-cloud migration, and financial applications with strict compliance requirements.

The core principle is to achieve environment decoupling through configuration centralization (ConfigMap/Secret) and externalization. The main methods include: 1) Kubernetes native ConfigMap injecting environment variables or mounting files; 2) Secret encrypting and managing sensitive data; 3) Combining Helm Charts to realize environment-specific configuration overriding through values.yaml; 4) Using external configuration centers (e.g., Spring Cloud Config, Azure App Configuration) to provide dynamic refresh capabilities. Best practices emphasize version control, audit logs, and least privilege access control.

Specific implementation steps: 1) Externalize configurations as environment variables or configuration files; 2) Use ConfigMap to manage non-sensitive configurations and Secret to store keys and certificates; 3) Define independent values.yaml for different environments through Helm; 4) Mount configuration volumes or inject environment variables into containers; 5) Encrypt sensitive data using SealedSecret or cloud key management services; 6) Establish CI/CD pipelines for configuration changes. This solution improves release reliability by over 50%, meets GDPR/HIPAA compliance audits, and supports second-level configuration hot updates.
