Application portability refers to the ability of applications to be seamlessly deployed and migrated across different cloud platforms. It is crucial for avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing business flexibility, and optimizing costs, and is commonly used in disaster recovery and global expansion scenarios with hybrid cloud or multi-cloud architectures.

Its core relies on containerization to package application components, Kubernetes to implement cross-cloud orchestration, infrastructure as code to unify environment configurations, and cloud-neutral API design. By standardizing the technology stack to abstract underlying cloud differences, it can simplify operations and maintenance, accelerate iterations, and significantly improve resource utilization and system resilience.

In practice, it is necessary to prioritize containerizing applications and using Kubernetes to manage clusters; define cloud resources with IaC tools such as Terraform; and ensure data storage and network compatibility. This reduces migration costs, supports dynamic load balancing, and enhances the business value of cross-cloud elastic scaling.
