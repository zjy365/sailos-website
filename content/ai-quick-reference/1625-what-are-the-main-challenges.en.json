  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the definition and management of infrastructure resources through scripts or code, replacing manual configuration. In cloud-native environments, such as containerization and microservices deployment, IaC is crucial as it enables on-demand elastic scaling of resources, rapid iterative deployment, and consistent maintenance. It is suitable for Kubernetes cluster orchestration and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, significantly improving operational efficiency and observability.\n\nKey challenges include the high complexity of infrastructure code, skill shortages requiring teams to master coding and cloud-native knowledge, difficulties in state management such as Terraform state drift or locking, and version control and collaboration issues leading to configuration conflicts. These characteristics affect practical applications, introducing deployment failures, security vulnerabilities, and compliance risks, hindering the reliability of automation and the scalability of large-scale systems.\n\nIdentifying these challenges in cloud-native migration helps enterprises optimize toolchains and governance processes. Its value lies in mitigating risks through standardization and automation, enhancing business agility, reliability, and cost efficiency, and enabling continuous innovation and security compliance."
