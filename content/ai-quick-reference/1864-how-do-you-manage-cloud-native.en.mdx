Cloud-native key management refers to the practice of securely handling sensitive information (such as API keys and certificates) in containerized environments, aiming to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Its importance lies in ensuring data privacy and compliance (e.g., GDPR), and it is particularly applicable to dynamically scalable microservice platforms like Kubernetes clusters, commonly used in microservice communication and database authentication scenarios.

Core components include key management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or AWS KMS), which support key generation, encrypted storage, automatic rotation, and dynamic injection, enabling least privilege access through centralized management. Features include audit logs and integrated APIs to ensure keys are not exposed in plaintext. In practical applications, such systems seamlessly integrate into Kubernetes via Secrets or proxy tools, significantly enhancing security posture, simplifying operations, and reducing the risk of human error.

Implementation steps: 1. Select a key management service (e.g., Vault or cloud-native solutions). 2. Configure Secrets objects in Kubernetes or use injectors (e.g., Vault Agent) to automatically load keys into Pods. 3. Enable automatic rotation and monitoring policies. Typical scenarios include dynamically passing credentials during application deployment, with business value in accelerating DevOps processes, reducing costs, and enhancing compliance, such as minimizing credential leakage incidents.
