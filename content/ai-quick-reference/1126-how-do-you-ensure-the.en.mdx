Hybrid cloud integrates public and private cloud resources, and ensuring secure data transmission is crucial to protect sensitive information from theft or misuse. Its importance lies in safeguarding data privacy and compliance, commonly used in scenarios such as cross-environment application migration, backup, and shared analytical data.

The core includes end-to-end encryption (e.g., TLS/IPsec), identity and access management (IAM), and secure tunneling technologies (e.g., VPN or cloud provider dedicated links). Features involve data integrity, the principle of least privilege, and real-time monitoring. In practical applications, encrypting transmitted data through secure gateways and implementing micro-segmentation to reduce the attack surface significantly enhance business continuity and compliance, such as meeting GDPR requirements.

Implementation steps: 1. Configure secure connection channels (e.g., AWS Direct Connect or VPN tunnels); 2. Enable TLS to encrypt all transmitted data; 3. Apply strict IAM policies and log auditing. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud data synchronization, with business values including reducing leakage risks, saving compliance costs, and enhancing customer trust.
