  "content": "In Terraform, the infrastructure state records the current resource configuration and is stored in a state file; state file locking prevents concurrent operation conflicts and ensures consistency. Its importance lies in avoiding resource conflicts and data corruption, applied in scenarios such as team collaboration and CI/CD pipelines to ensure deployment reliability.\n\nThe core includes remote state storage (e.g., AWS S3) and locking mechanisms (e.g., DynamoDB tables). Locking principle: automatically acquired before operation and released after completion. It features support for multiple backends and is managed through Terraform commands. In practical applications, in shared environments such as multi-user deployments, locking prevents race conditions, with the impact of improving state integrity and reducing errors.\n\nDuring implementation, configure a remote backend (e.g., S3) and enable locking options (e.g., setting up a DynamoDB table). Steps: define a backend block in the configuration, and use `terraform apply` to automatically handle locking. Typical scenarios include shared team projects; business value includes enhancing security, reducing downtime risks, and optimizing deployment efficiency."
