CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) is an automated process used to frequently integrate code changes, test, and deploy, aiming to reduce human errors and accelerate the release cycle. Its importance lies in ensuring rapid software iteration and zero-downtime updates, with application scenarios including frequent deployments in web applications or microservice architectures.

The core components include code commit triggering, automated build and test phases, and deployment strategies (such as blue-green deployment). Features like repeatability and real-time feedback ensure code quality and stability. In practical applications, it improves deployment reliability, affects development team efficiency, reduces risks, and supports rapid response in cloud-native environments.

Implementation steps are: 1) Set up source code management tools to trigger builds; 2) Integrate automated testing to verify functionality; 3) Adopt progressive deployment (such as canary release) to gradually roll out new versions; 4) Monitor and automatically roll back issues. Typical scenarios are service updates and patch releases, with business values including reducing downtime, improving product quality, and accelerating market delivery.
