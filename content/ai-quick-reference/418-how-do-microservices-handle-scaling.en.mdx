Microservices is an architectural style that decomposes applications into small independent services. When handling scaling in distributed systems, it应对负载增长 by independently increasing service instances to ensure system elasticity and high availability. This scaling method is crucial in high-performance scenarios such as e-commerce, supporting smooth operation during traffic surges.

Core mechanisms include horizontal scaling using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to实现自动缩放, service discovery, and load balancing. Features such as partitioned design reduce single points of failure and improve resource utilization, driving cloud-native transformation in practical applications, simplifying operations and maintenance, and accelerating iterative development.

Implementation steps involve setting monitoring metrics, configuring automated scaling policies such as HPA, and dynamically adjusting instances based on CPU or traffic. Typical scenarios include efficient scaling during user peak periods, with business value reflected in cost reduction, improved reliability, and optimized user experience.
