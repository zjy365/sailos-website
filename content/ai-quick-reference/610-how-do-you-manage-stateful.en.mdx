Cloud-native environments like Kubernetes provide containerization, microservices, and automated orchestration to dynamically adapt to load changes. Stateful applications such as databases rely on persistent data states, and managing this in the cloud is crucial to support core scenarios like e-commerce order systems and distributed storage.

Core mechanisms include the StatefulSet component, which ensures Pods have unique network identities and are deployed in order. Combining PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) provides persistent storage, integrated with distributed storage like Ceph. When applied to database clusters such as Redis, it ensures data consistency and high availability, supporting cloud-native elasticity.

Implementation steps: 1. Define a StatefulSet to deploy application instances; 2. Configure PVCs to bind PVs for storage persistence; 3. Use a Headless Service to provide stable access points. A typical scenario is running a MySQL cluster to process transactional data. Business values include automatic scaling to reduce costs and rapid failure recovery to improve availability.
