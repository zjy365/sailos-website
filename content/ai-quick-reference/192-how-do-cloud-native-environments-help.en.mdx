Cloud-native environments effectively support the operation and management of serverless applications by providing standardized infrastructure abstraction and management capabilities. Their core significance lies in eliminating server management burdens, allowing developers to focus on business logic, thereby greatly improving development efficiency and agility. They are suitable for event-driven, on-demand execution scenarios with fluctuating traffic (such as API backends and data processing pipelines).

The supporting core is cloud-native infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes) as the underlying resource pool, combined with serverless frameworks (e.g., Knative, OpenFaaS). Cloud-native features such as automated container orchestration (auto-scaling), service mesh (service discovery and security), declarative APIs, and powerful observability toolchains (logging, monitoring, tracing) provide serverless functions with an elastic execution environment, seamless connectivity, and clear operational insights.

Practical implementation typically involves deploying serverless platform components based on K8s: building function code and packaging it into container images; defining triggers (HTTP requests, message queues, etc.) and functions through the platform; and configuring auto-scaling policies. The platform automatically handles resource provisioning, instance scheduling, cold starts, and network connectivity. Its key business values lie in significantly reducing operational complexity, enabling fine-grained billing based on actual computing resource consumption (ultimate cost optimization), and ensuring high application availability and on-demand elasticity.
