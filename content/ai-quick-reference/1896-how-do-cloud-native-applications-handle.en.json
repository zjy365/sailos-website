  "content": "Resource isolation ensures that different tenants or components in cloud-native applications do not interfere with each other's resource usage, while the multi-tenancy problem refers to the isolation and security requirements when sharing infrastructure. This is crucial in Kubernetes platforms to prevent resource conflicts and improve cloud deployment efficiency, such as ensuring fair access and reliability in public cloud or microservice environments.\n\nCore mechanisms include Kubernetes namespaces for isolating logical tenant groups, resource quotas for limiting CPU/memory, network policies for controlling inter-Pod communication, and RBAC for managing permissions. Features are based on container sandboxing and service meshes to implement secure multi-tenant architectures in virtual machine or bare-metal environments. Practical applications provide tenant-level isolation in SaaS platforms or financial services, significantly enhancing scalability and compliance.\n\nProcessing steps: Create namespaces to allocate tenants, set resource quotas to define limits, configure network policies to isolate traffic, and apply RBAC to authorize role access. Typically used in multi-tenant scenarios such as e-commerce or healthcare, it optimizes resource utilization, reduces operational costs, and ensures data security and business continuity."
