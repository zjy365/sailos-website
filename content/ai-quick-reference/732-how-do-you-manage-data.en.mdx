Managing data in cloud-native containerized environments requires addressing ephemerality, dynamicity, and microservice sharing needs. Persistent storage is crucial for databases, stateful applications, logs, and user files, serving as the core infrastructure to ensure application state and business continuity.

The core involves abstracting storage resources through the Container Storage Interface, separating storage provisioning and consumption using Persistent Volumes and Claims, which are then mounted to specific Pods by the orchestrator. Distributed storage, the Operator pattern, and StatefulSet controllers collectively provide stable data identity and sequencing guarantees. Implement data backup and disaster recovery strategies, combined with monitoring and logging tools to ensure full-lifecycle visibility.

Implementation steps: First, define storage requirement types. Create PVCs to bind backend PV resources via declarations. Mount PVCs in Pods to enable data access. Deploy regular backup (e.g., Velero), cross-AZ replication, and encryption strategies for critical data. Utilize cloud-managed databases or Operators (e.g., Prometheus) to simplify complex scenario management, ultimately supporting application elastic scaling and zero-downtime maintenance.
