Cloud-native databases are distributed systems optimized for cloud environments, supporting automatic scaling and high availability. Multi-region data replication ensures business continuity, disaster recovery, and compliance with data sovereignty regulations by synchronizing data across geographies. It is crucial for global applications such as e-commerce or finance to avoid single points of failure and reduce access latency.

It is fundamentally based on database engine mechanisms like MySQL asynchronous replication or cloud services such as AWS RDS Multi-AZ, integrating partition tolerance, automatic failover, and data consistency models. Features include network configuration optimization and conflict resolution. In practical applications, it improves availability to over 99.99%, supports low-latency user access and disaster recovery, and impacts areas such as cross-border data governance.

Implementation steps include: 1) Selecting multi-region-supported services like Google Cloud Spanner; 2) Deploying database instances across target regions; 3) Configuring replication topologies and monitoring; 4) Validating failover. Typical scenarios include global website backends, with business values of improving user satisfaction, ensuring business continuity, and reducing regional outage losses.
