Multi-cloud cost management refers to controlling expenditures in multiple cloud service provider environments to prevent resource waste and cost overruns. Its importance lies in optimizing the overall IT budget, applied in enterprise hybrid cloud deployment scenarios to ensure financial compliance and efficient resource utilization.

Core components include unified monitoring tools (such as CloudHealth or native services), cost analysis, and budget control strategies. Features encompass real-time consumption tracking, resource tag classification, and automated alerts; the principle is based on data-driven decision-making to optimize resource allocation and reduce idle instances. Practical application improves the ROI of cloud-native applications and reduces the risk of overspending by up to 30%.

Implementation steps: Integrate cloud billing data sources, deploy monitoring tools to set budget thresholds, analyze consumption patterns to identify waste points, and apply auto-scaling strategies such as shutting down idle resources. Business values include significant cost savings (e.g., 20% reduction), improved operational agility, and support for sustainable development goals.
