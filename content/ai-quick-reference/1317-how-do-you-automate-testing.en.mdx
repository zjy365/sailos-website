CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) combined with automated testing is crucial for cloud-native applications. It accelerates the software delivery cycle and ensures code quality and high availability by automating the build, test, and deployment processes. Application scenarios include deploying containerized microservices in Kubernetes environments, supporting rapid iteration and elastic scaling.

Core components include CI servers (such as Jenkins), Git integration to trigger tests, automated testing frameworks (such as Selenium or Jest), and CD tools (such as Argo CD) for deployment. Key features are pipeline definition and infrastructure as code, ensuring repeatable and reliable testing. In practical applications, automated testing covers unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, verifying container behavior in cloud-native environments, significantly improving application reliability and agile development efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Configure the CI pipeline to add an automated testing phase and write test scripts to cover key functions. 2. Integrate test results as deployment gates in the CD process. 3. Monitor test coverage and feedback. Business value includes shortening deployment time and reducing defect rates, with typical scenarios such as automatically verifying cloud-native API or microservice stability in continuous delivery.
