Version control for cloud-native APIs and microservices is a strategy for managing changes to API interfaces and services, which is crucial in cloud-native architectures to ensure independent service evolution, compatibility assurance, and zero-downtime deployments. Application scenarios include large-scale distributed systems and CI/CD pipelines, supporting rapid iteration and system stability.

Its core components include version identification (such as URI path /v1 or header information), backward compatibility design, and dynamic routing mechanisms of service mesh tools (e.g., Istio). In practical applications, progressive updates are achieved through canary releases and A/B testing, significantly enhancing system flexibility, reliability, and fault tolerance, reducing coupling in microservice architectures, and optimizing user experience.

During implementation, first develop a semantic versioning strategy; then use an API gateway (e.g., Kubernetes Ingress or Nginx) to manage request routing; deploy multi-version service containers and enable rolling updates; monitor error rates to ensure compatibility. A typical scenario is canary deployment, which brings business values such as low-risk deployment, accelerated innovation, and efficient operation and maintenance.
