Container orchestration automates container lifecycle management, and CI/CD pipelines automate software building and deployment. Their combination enhances application delivery efficiency, reliability, and scalability, suitable for rapid iteration scenarios in cloud-native environments and DevOps practices.

The core components include CI tools that build container images and push them to registries, followed by deployment and updates via orchestration tools like Kubernetes, which support rolling updates and self-healing. In practical applications, it reduces human errors, promotes continuous delivery, significantly speeds up the process from development to production, with impacts including enhanced team collaboration and innovation potential.

Implementation steps: 1. Build and test images in the CI phase; 2. Store images in registries; 3. Trigger orchestration tools to automatically deploy changes; 4. Monitor and roll back. Typical scenarios include seamless application updates, with business values of accelerating time-to-market, reducing operational costs, and improving system resilience.
