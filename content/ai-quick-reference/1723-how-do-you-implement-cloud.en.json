  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates cloud resource deployment through code, while cloud cost management focuses on monitoring and optimizing expenditures. This integration is crucial in CI/CD pipelines, as it can proactively prevent budget overruns,适用于 cloud-native application deployment scenarios, and ensures cost control throughout the development cycle.\n\nCore components include cost estimation tools (such as Infracost integrated with Terraform), budget definition, and real-time monitoring functions. The principle is to embed cost constraints into the code to achieve automated tracking and alerting. Practical applications, such as running cost simulations before deployment, can enhance financial governance and drive development teams to optimize resource selection.\n\nImplementation steps: First, integrate cost plugins (such as Infracost) into IaC tools; second, add stages in the CI/CD process for cost verification (pre-deployment estimation); finally, continuously monitor and adjust resources after deployment. A typical scenario is cost preview during code reviews, and the business value includes reducing operating expenses by 20%-30%."
