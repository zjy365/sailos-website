Protecting hybrid cloud applications from cyber threats is the process of defending against cyber attacks in hybrid deployments that combine public cloud, private cloud, and on-premises environments. Its importance lies in ensuring data security, meeting compliance requirements (such as GDPR), and maintaining business continuity, applicable to high-security industry scenarios like finance and healthcare.

The core of this concept includes the zero-trust security model (based on identity authentication and least privilege access), network segmentation (isolating different components such as containers and VMs), encrypted transmission (e.g., TLS/SSL), and real-time threat detection (using AI tools to identify anomalies). In practical applications, these components achieve unified policy management through integrating cloud-native security platforms (such as Istio or Calico), enhancing system resilience and reducing the risk of data breaches, thereby supporting agile development and regulatory compliance.

Implementation steps are as follows: deploy zero-trust architecture through strong identity authentication; configure firewalls and WAF to protect boundaries; enable end-to-end encryption; integrate threat intelligence and monitoring systems; conduct regular audits and update policies. Typical scenarios include secure migration and DevSecOps practices, with business values of reducing the cost of security incidents (by more than 50%) and ensuring operational stability and trust building.
