  "content": "A multi-cloud environment involves multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure). Cloud-native data backup protects data in containerized (such as Kubernetes) applications. Its importance lies in ensuring high availability, avoiding vendor lock-in, and meeting compliance requirements, applied in cross-regional disaster recovery and microservice application scenarios.\n\nCore components include cross-cloud compatible tools (such as Velero), characterized by automated scheduling, version management, and platform independence. The principle is to implement distributed storage using cloud-native APIs. In practical applications, it provides seamless backup for Kubernetes clusters, enhances business continuity and resilience, and reduces the risk of data loss.\n\nImplementation steps: Evaluate and select tools; define backup strategies (frequency and retention period); configure storage locations (such as S3 buckets); integrate automated monitoring. Typical scenarios include multi-cluster DevOps environments. Business values include reducing failure losses, supporting audit compliance, and achieving cost optimization."
