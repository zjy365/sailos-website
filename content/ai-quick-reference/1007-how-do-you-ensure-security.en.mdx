Multi-cloud architecture involves integrating multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure), where security is crucial. It can avoid single points of failure, reduce the risk of data breaches, and support compliance requirements. Application scenarios include when enterprises pursue resilience, disaster recovery, and avoidance of vendor lock-in.

Core components include unified Identity and Access Management (IAM), end-to-end data encryption, and network segmentation (such as firewalls). The principle is based on the zero-trust model, emphasizing continuous verification of access permissions. In practical applications, automated tools unify policy enforcement, enhance threat detection capabilities, and significantly improve compliance and business continuity across cloud environments.

Implementation steps: 1. Risk assessment and strategy definition; 2. Deployment of centralized IAM; 3. Encryption of data in transit and at rest; 4. Real-time monitoring and audit log analysis. Typical scenarios include application migration or multi-cloud workload deployment. Business values include reducing the attack surface, ensuring compliant operations, and optimizing cost efficiency.
