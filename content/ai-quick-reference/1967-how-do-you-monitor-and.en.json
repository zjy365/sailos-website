  "content": "Monitoring and auditing are key practices for securing resources in cloud-native applications, involving real-time tracking of access events and analysis of historical records to ensure security, compliance, and reliability. Their importance lies in preventing data breaches and meeting regulations such as GDPR/HIPAA, with wide application in Kubernetes container clusters and microservices architectures.\n\nCore components include monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus for metrics collection), audit logging systems (e.g., Fluentd integrated with the ELK Stack for log collection), and policy engines (e.g., OPA for enforcing RBAC rules). Features include real-time alerts, fine-grained logging, and event-based audit trails. In practical applications, they detect unauthorized access, support incident response, and improve overall security posture and resource efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy log aggregation tools to collect access logs; 2. Integrate identity management (e.g., Kubernetes RBAC); 3. Configure policy rules and real-time alerts; 4. Establish monitoring dashboards (e.g., Grafana); 5. Regularly review audit data. Business values include enhanced security compliance and reduced operational risks, with typical scenarios such as service mesh API traffic control."
