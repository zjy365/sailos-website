  "content": "In cloud-native environments, compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR or CCPA is crucial to prevent data breaches, legal fines, and reputational damage. Its importance stems from the dynamic microservices and containerization characteristics of cloud-native, which require protecting user privacy throughout the entire data processing lifecycle, applicable to sensitive data scenarios in finance, healthcare, and other sectors.\n\nThe core includes technical controls such as end-to-end encryption (at rest and in transit), RBAC permission management, automated security configuration, as well as organizational measures like policy formulation and audit logging. In practical applications, Kubernetes stores sensitive information through Secrets, service meshes (e.g., Istio) implement TLS encryption, and network policies are combined to isolate traffic, enhancing compliance agility while supporting a zero-trust architecture.\n\nImplementation steps: First, identify and classify sensitive data; second, deploy control mechanisms such as least privilege access and automatic encryption; third, integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) to audit operations; finally, continuously train teams and conduct regular compliance assessments. Business value includes reducing violation risks by over 50%, enhancing customer trust, and facilitating secure global business deployment."
