  "content": "Containerization is a lightweight virtualization technology that packages applications and their dependencies into isolated, portable units, ensuring consistent operation. It is crucial in cloud-native development as it supports rapid deployment, environmental consistency, and DevOps practices, applied in microservices architectures and continuous integration scenarios.\n\nCore components include container images (packaging applications and libraries) and runtimes (such as Docker), characterized by resource efficiency, isolation, and quick startup. Based on operating system-level virtualization principles, containerization enables applications to run seamlessly in cloud environments, with practical impacts including enhanced agility, optimized resource utilization, and driving the expansion and resilience of the cloud-native ecosystem.\n\nIntegration into cloud-native development is achieved through container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for automated deployment, scaling, and monitoring. Steps include containerizing applications and integrating CI/CD pipelines, with typical scenarios involving microservices governance and hybrid cloud deployment, delivering business value such as accelerated innovation, reduced costs, and improved system resilience."
