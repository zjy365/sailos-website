Observability tools such as Prometheus or the ELK Stack are used for real-time monitoring of configuration files and infrastructure changes, ensuring system stability, security, and audit compliance. Their importance lies in preventing configuration drift and failures, with application scenarios including configMaps in Kubernetes environments or infrastructure-as-code management.

The core components include configuration management integration, event log aggregation, and change tracking capabilities, featuring version history comparison and automated alerts. For example, using tools in conjunction with GitOps practices to automatically record Terraform or Ansible updates, which in practical applications reduces downtime and improves operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: Integrate configuration sources with the observability platform; set up monitoring rules to detect changes; configure real-time alert notifications for the team. A typical scenario is tracking code updates in CI/CD pipelines. Business values include preventing incorrect deployments, ensuring compliance, and reducing operational risks.
