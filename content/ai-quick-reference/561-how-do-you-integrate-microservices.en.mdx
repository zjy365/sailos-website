Microservice architecture splits applications into independent, deployable small services; external third-party APIs are interfaces provided by external vendors. Integration is crucial as it extends microservice functionalities, avoids duplicate development, and is suitable for scenarios such as payment processing, real-time data access, or social media interaction.

Core components include an API gateway as a unified entry point, security mechanisms like OAuth authentication, and asynchronous communication patterns such as message queues. Features involve loose coupling and high availability; in practical applications, integration supports microservices in calling weather services or payment gateways, enhancing overall system flexibility and driving innovation.

Implementation steps: 1. Obtain an API key and configure permissions. 2. Use an HTTP client in the microservice to initiate requests. 3. Parse responses and handle errors. A typical scenario is an e-commerce microservice calling a payment API; the business value is reducing development costs and accelerating time to market.
