Microservices architecture enhances code reusability by decomposing monolithic applications into small, independent services. This promotes modular design, reduces redundant development, and is suitable for high-concurrency and cloud-native systems such as e-commerce platforms or financial services, supporting agile development and scalability.

The core includes service autonomy, clear boundaries, and standard API communication (e.g., REST or gRPC). Each service focuses on a single function and exposes business logic through interfaces. This loosely coupled nature makes services reusable units. In practical applications, shared services (such as authentication or payment modules) can be invoked by multiple applications, thereby accelerating iteration and reducing duplicate code.

During implementation: identify common functions; encapsulate them into independent microservices; define standardized API interfaces; and achieve reuse through inter-service calls. A typical scenario is deployment in a Kubernetes cluster, bringing business values including a 40% reduction in development costs, accelerated innovation, and improved system maintainability.
