To ensure multi-cloud data encryption, it is necessary to protect data in transit, at rest, and in use. The key is to prevent cross-platform data leakage and meet compliance requirements (such as GDPR and HIPAA). Its importance lies in the fact that the dispersion of data in multi-cloud architectures increases the attack surface, making encryption a unified security baseline applicable to scenarios involving cross-cloud migration of sensitive data in finance, healthcare, and other sectors.

The core implementation includes three layers: The transport layer uses the TLS 1.3 protocol to encrypt cross-cloud traffic, with certificates automatically managed through service meshes (e.g., Istio); The storage layer combines cloud platform KMS (e.g., AWS KMS/Azure Key Vault) with third-party tools (HashiCorp Vault) for key management, applying server-side encryption (SSE) or client-side encryption; The application layer needs to integrate encryption libraries (e.g., Libsodium) to handle in-memory data. The key principle is ""separation of keys and data"" to avoid cloud service providers hosting root keys.

Implementation steps: 1) Develop a unified encryption policy specifying encryption standards for data across clouds; 2) Deploy a centralized key management system that supports multi-cloud interfaces; 3) Enable server-side encryption for object storage (e.g., S3 SSE-KMS); 4) Configure network encryption gateways to manage cross-cloud traffic; 5) Use cloud-native tools (e.g., cert-manager) to automate certificate rotation. The business value lies in reducing compliance costs, enhancing customer trust, and preventing comprehensive data exposure due to the failure of a single cloud provider.
