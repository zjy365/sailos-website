  "content": "In a microservices environment, inter-service authentication ensures that only authorized services can communicate with each other. It is the cornerstone of building a zero-trust architecture, protecting data security, and preventing malicious access, and is crucial for the security of API calls and the overall integrity of the system.\n\nCore methods include: 1) API gateways centrally handle entry authentication to simplify internal service logic; 2) Use lightweight tokens (such as JWT or OAuth2 tokens), where services carry tokens in request headers for receivers to verify; 3) Service meshes (such as Istio) automatically manage service certificates and implement mTLS (mutual TLS) for strong authentication and encryption at the transport layer. The choice of solution depends on architectural complexity and security requirements.\n\nImplementation steps typically involve: 1) Selecting an authentication strategy (tokens or mTLS); 2) Configuring a unified certificate authority (CA) or identity provider (IdP); 3) Generating/assigning unique identity identifiers and certificates/keys for services; 4) Integrating authentication/verification logic (such as verifying JWT signatures or establishing mTLS connections) in service code or sidecar proxies; 5) Managing credential rotation. Mainstream solutions significantly simplify authentication management, enhance security transparency, and meet compliance requirements."
