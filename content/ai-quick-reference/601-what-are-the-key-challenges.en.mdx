Cloud-native environments are based on containers and microservices, emphasizing portability and elastic scalability; data management is crucial in such environments to ensure the reliability and performance of distributed applications, with applicable scenarios including dynamic service scaling, cross-cloud deployment, and real-time data processing.

Key challenges include data persistence (the ephemeral nature of containers requires external storage), consistency issues (complexity of distributed transactions), security compliance (multi-tenant isolation and encryption), and integration complexity (across multi-cloud environments). These challenges affect system reliability, and in practical applications, data integrity is maintained through StatefulSets or CSI drivers.

Effective management to address these challenges supports business resilience, innovative applications (such as AI/ML), and provides values including data-driven decision-making and optimization of resource efficiency.
