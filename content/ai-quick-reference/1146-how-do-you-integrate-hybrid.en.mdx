Hybrid cloud services combine public and private cloud resources to provide flexible infrastructure for DevOps. Their importance lies in supporting seamless cross-environment deployment, elastic resource scaling, and cost optimization, applicable to scenarios such as testing, disaster recovery, and production environment load distribution.

The core of integration is unified orchestration and automation. Application portability is achieved through containerization (e.g., Kubernetes), and API integration is used for hybrid cloud platform management interfaces. CI/CD pipelines leverage IaC tools like Terraform to unify resource configuration, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments; meanwhile, public cloud elastic resources are utilized to accelerate builds, and private clouds ensure the security of sensitive data, significantly increasing release frequency and system resilience.

The specific implementation steps are as follows: First, define the hybrid cloud resource topology using IaC; second, integrate cloud service APIs into the CI/CD toolchain (e.g., Jenkins/GitLab CI) to enable automated deployment across cloud environments; third, orchestrate container applications through Kubernetes to uniformly schedule hybrid clusters; finally, implement monitoring and security policies (e.g., compliance scanning) to form a closed-loop feedback optimization process. This reduces the delivery cycle by more than 30% and lowers infrastructure dependency risks.
