Monitoring and logging tools are used in CI/CD pipeline management to track build, test, and deployment processes in real-time, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of automation. Their importance lies in providing insights, early error detection, and alerts, applied in DevOps environments to accelerate software delivery and reduce the risk of failures.

Core components include metrics monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) that capture build success rates and deployment times, as well as log aggregation systems (such as the ELK Stack) that analyze error logs. Features include real-time alerts and dashboard visualization. Practical applications involve quickly identifying bottlenecks or failures, optimizing pipeline performance, and improving team productivity and iteration speed.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate tools like Jenkins with Prometheus for monitoring; 2. Configure log collection using Fluentd or similar tools; 3. Set up alert rules and visualization dashboards. A typical scenario is quickly detecting deployment failures and automatically rolling back. Business values include shortening recovery time, enhancing software quality, and reducing operational costs.
