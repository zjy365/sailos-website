  "content": "Cloud-native platforms are frameworks for deploying and managing containerized applications, such as Kubernetes. Their importance lies in providing scalability, elasticity, and continuous delivery capabilities. They are suitable for application scenarios requiring agile development, efficient resource utilization, and high availability, such as e-commerce, finance, and online services, to enable rapid iteration and reduce operational costs.\n\nCore components include container orchestration engines (e.g., Kubernetes), service meshes (e.g., Istio), and CI/CD tools. Features include automated deployment, elastic scaling, and multi-cloud compatibility. In practical applications, they support microservices architecture, promote DevOps culture, enhance application reliability, and drive innovation, resource optimization, and the development of hybrid cloud strategies in the cloud computing domain.\n\nWhen selecting an appropriate platform, first analyze application requirements, including performance goals, scale growth, and security compliance; then evaluate platform options (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or open-source Kubernetes), considering costs, vendor support, and service level agreements (SLA); typical scenarios involve cloud migration or new application deployment, ultimately delivering business value such as accelerating time-to-market, optimizing resource utilization, and enhancing system resilience."
