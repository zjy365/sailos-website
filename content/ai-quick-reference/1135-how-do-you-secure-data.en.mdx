Hybrid cloud environments combine private and public cloud resources to provide flexibility and scalability, but storing data across multiple platforms increases security risks. Protecting data security, including preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data integrity and availability, is crucial for enterprises handling sensitive data such as PII or PHI, such as those in the financial or healthcare industries, to ensure business continuity and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR).

Core measures include access control (e.g., RBAC and IAM), data encryption (TLS for data in transit and KMS for data at rest), strong identity authentication, network isolation, and real-time log monitoring. A unified strategy is required, integrating cloud security tools like CASB or cloud-native solutions to achieve consistent protection in hybrid environments. Practical application enhances threat detection and response, reduces leakage risks, and supports enterprise needs for agile development and data sharing.

Implementation steps: 1. Define consistent security policies; 2. Deploy IAM and least privilege; 3. Encrypt data comprehensively; 4. Integrate monitoring and alert systems; 5. Conduct regular audits, backups, and recovery tests. Business value is reflected in reduced risks, improved compliance (e.g., fewer fines), and enhanced business resilience.
