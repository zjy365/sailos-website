  "content": "Large-scale cloud-native application monitoring requires efficient tracking of the health, performance, and dependencies of containerized microservices. Its importance lies in ensuring the stable operation of highly available, dynamically scalable environments, with application scenarios including rapid fault localization, performance optimization, and SLA guarantee.\n\nCore implementation requires building a scalable monitoring stack: deploying a Prometheus cluster to collect time-series metrics, combined with Service Discovery to automatically discover dynamic Pods; using Thanos or Cortex to achieve cross-cluster long-term metric storage and global querying; standardizing logs, distributed tracing (Jaeger), and metric data through OpenTelemetry; implementing visualization with Grafana and managing alerting policies with Alertmanager. Key challenges include reducing resource overhead and handling massive data traffic spikes.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n1. Data collection layer: Embed lightweight Exporters (such as Prometheus Node Exporter) within containers, and integrate applications with the OpenTelemetry SDK\n\n2. Service discovery: Configure Prometheus to automatically identify monitoring targets based on the Kubernetes API\n\n3. Storage scaling: Deploy Thanos Sidecar for metric sharding and use object storage as a long-term repository\n\n4. Visualization and alerting: Connect Grafana to multiple data sources and route alerts hierarchically via Alertmanager\n\n5. Service mesh integration: Obtain fine-grained traffic monitoring through Istio and associate with distributed tracing\n\nAdditional optimizations: Implement non-intrusive monitoring using eBPF technology and manage configurations via GitOps."
