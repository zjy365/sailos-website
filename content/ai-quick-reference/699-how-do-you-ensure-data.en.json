  "content": "In a cloud-native multi-cloud environment, data consistency refers to the accuracy and synchronization status of data across different cloud platforms, which is a core requirement for business continuity. Its importance lies in avoiding data conflicts (such as duplicate orders) and ensuring service resilience (such as cross-regional disaster recovery), and it is commonly found in scenarios like financial transactions and globalized applications.\n\nCore mechanisms include distributed transaction protocols (such as Saga or TCC), event sourcing patterns (tracking changes through immutable logs), and multi-active database architectures (such as CQRS). In terms of characteristics, a balance must be struck between strong consistency and eventual consistency (for example, user profile updates can tolerate delays of a few seconds). This pattern relies on service meshes to implement cross-cloud communication governance and uses cloud-native tools (such as Prometheus) to monitor data latency and conflicts in real time.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n1. Select a consistency model (such as an AP system prioritizing partition tolerance);\n\n2. Deploy a global transaction coordinator (such as Seata);\n\n3. Use CDC tools (such as Debezium) to capture data change events;\n\n4. Enforce data format validation through Schema Registry;\n\n5. Establish rollback and repair processes (such as automatic compensation transactions).\n\nThe business value is to improve cross-cloud scalability and reduce lock-in risks."
