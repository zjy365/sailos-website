  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates resource configuration through scripts, with scalability supporting dynamic system growth based on load, and efficiency optimizing resource utilization to avoid waste. Its importance lies in ensuring the elasticity and high availability of cloud-native environments and containerized deployments (such as Kubernetes), applied in scenarios of large-scale cloud service expansion and continuous delivery.\n\nCore components include modular design to enhance code reusability, version control (e.g., Git) to manage change history, and automated testing to verify script reliability. In practical applications, by dynamically scheduling resources (such as automatically scaling container instances), it increases deployment speed and reduces configuration errors, significantly impacting operational cost savings and DevOps process efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: First, structure scripts into reusable modules; second, integrate unit testing and continuous deployment pipelines; finally, monitor and optimize resource configuration. Business value includes accelerating iteration cycles, reducing failure rates, and supporting reliability and cost-effectiveness under business growth."
