IaC (Infrastructure as Code) defines and automates infrastructure management through code. Key terms include using declarative languages (such as Terraform) to implement resource configuration. Its importance lies in enhancing consistency, repeatability, and efficiency. Application scenarios include automatically deploying resources in hybrid or multi-cloud environments (such as AWS, Azure) to optimize costs and agility.

Core components include code templates, version control systems (such as Git), and state management. Features include cross-cloud compatibility, testability, and version rollback capabilities. In practical applications, IaC abstracts cloud provider differences through unified tools (such as Terraform), ensuring consistent resource configuration across multiple cloud platforms. Impact areas include migration strategy optimization, risk reduction, and operational automation.

Implementation steps include: selecting tools (such as Terraform or cross-cloud frameworks), defining code templates for various cloud services, and integrating CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment and monitoring. A typical scenario is cross-cloud application deployment, with business value体现 in avoiding vendor lock-in, elastic scaling, and cost savings (for example, through unified resource pool management).
