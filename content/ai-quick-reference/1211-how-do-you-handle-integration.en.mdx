Integration testing in CI/CD pipelines involves automated verification of the correctness of interactions between multiple components or systems to ensure consistent functional behavior after integration. Its importance lies in detecting interface errors early, preventing defects from entering the production environment, and improving software reliability. Application scenarios include automatically running tests during the continuous integration phase, suitable for rapid iterative development processes such as Web applications and microservice architectures.

Core components include testing frameworks (such as Selenium or Postman), testing environments (such as Docker containers), and tool integrations (such as JUnit or API testing). Features include parallel execution, environment isolation, and coverage analysis to reduce testing time. In practical applications, test phases are configured through CI tools (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions) for end-to-end verification, which affects development efficiency: automatically reporting errors accelerates fixes and reduces deployment failures by more than 20%.

Implementation steps: 1. Configure integration test tasks in the pipeline; 2. Automatically execute test suites; 3. Set test pass thresholds to advance deployment. Typical scenarios are used for API verification between microservices. Business value includes reducing production failure risks by 50%, improving user satisfaction, and saving maintenance costs.
