Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Microservices architecture breaks down monolithic applications into independent, separately deployable services, enhancing development agility and scalability. It is widely applied in cloud-native applications such as e-commerce and financial systems. Kubernetes supports microservices operations by providing high availability and resource optimization, ensuring reliable operation in dynamic environments.

Core features include service discovery (e.g., Service objects connecting microservices), load balancing, rolling updates (managing versions through Deployments), and autoscaling (adjusting resources via Horizontal Pod Autoscaler). These enable self-healing capabilities and isolated deployment of microservices, allowing teams to independently develop and maintain services, significantly improving system resilience and development efficiency, and promoting DevOps practices.

Implementation steps: Containerize microservices into images and deploy them to Kubernetes Pods, expose network interfaces using Services, and configure ReplicaSets to ensure high availability. Typical scenarios include enabling health probes to monitor status and integrating CI/CD pipelines for automated releases. The resulting business value includes accelerated iteration, reduced operational costs, optimized resource utilization, and improved user experience.
