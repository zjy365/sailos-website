A failover strategy refers to a mechanism that automatically switches to a backup system when a system fails. It is crucial for automated deployment and ensures high availability. Its importance lies in minimizing downtime, with application scenarios including Kubernetes cluster deployment in cloud-native environments to support seamless service continuity.

The core components include health checks (such as Kubernetes readiness probes), automatic rerouting tools (such as load balancers), and monitoring systems. It is characterized by being event-driven and based on fault-tolerant algorithms, with the principle of quickly detecting and transferring traffic. In practical applications, it is implemented through Kubernetes Pod anti-affinity or cloud services like AWS ELB in the automated deployment process, significantly improving system resilience and reducing business interruptions.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate health check automation into the CI/CD pipeline. 2. Configure load balancers to set up automatic rerouting (e.g., in GCP or Istio). 3. Deploy multiple replicas and test using cloud tools. 4. Optimize with monitoring and alerting. Business value: Reduce downtime risks, enhance SLA compliance rates, and improve user experience.
