Serverless infrastructure refers to a cloud service model where developers do not need to manage server instances, and applications run automatically based on event triggers (such as HTTP requests). Configuring automated deployment is crucial for improving efficiency and reliability, suitable for scenarios like microservices and API backends, enabling zero-downtime updates and continuous innovation.

Core components include CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins), infrastructure as code tools (e.g., Serverless Framework or Terraform), and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda). In practical applications, code commits automatically trigger the build, test, and deployment processes, eliminating human errors, improving resource utilization, and promoting the maturity of DevOps culture.

Implementation steps: 1. Configure a version control system (e.g., GitHub); 2. Define pipeline stages (build, test) in CI/CD tools; 3. Write IaC files to describe resources; 4. Integrate testing frameworks; 5. Automate deployment to the serverless environment. Business values include accelerating release cycles (e.g., minute-level deployment), reducing operational costs, and enhancing application elasticity.
