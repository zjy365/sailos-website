To ensure cloud-native applications have scalability in a hybrid cloud environment, it is necessary to address cross-cloud resource coordination and seamless elastic scaling. Its importance lies in supporting business growth on demand, optimizing resource costs, and enhancing disaster recovery capabilities. Application scenarios include handling traffic peaks, cross-regional deployment, and leveraging the advantages of different cloud platforms.

The core lies in achieving unified cross-cloud orchestration, auto-scaling, service discovery, and state management. Key features include: using Kubernetes Cluster Federation or multi-cloud orchestration platforms to abstract underlying resources; deploying horizontal and vertical auto-scaling components to monitor application metrics and dynamically schedule instances; adopting service meshes to enable cross-cloud service access and load balancing; and prioritizing the design of stateless applications or using distributed storage/data synchronization mechanisms to handle state. This eliminates the limitations of a single cloud provider and achieves true global elasticity.

Implementation steps:

1. Unified orchestration layer: Deploy Kubernetes Federation, Cluster API, or professional multi-cloud management platforms to centrally manage clusters distributed across different clouds.

2. Configure auto-scaling: Enable HPA and VPA in clusters to adjust Pod replicas and resource requests in real-time based on custom or standard metrics.

3. Service governance and networking: Deploy service meshes to manage cross-cloud service communication, traffic splitting, and load balancing.

4. Manage stateful services: Use multi-cloud-supporting Operators or distributed storage solutions to handle stateful services such as databases.

5. Location-aware scheduling: Use label/taint scheduling policies to prioritize placing Pods in cloud environments with optimal cost or performance. Business values include maximizing resource utilization, more flexible response to sudden traffic, significant cost optimization, and enhanced overall system resilience.
