In cloud-native applications, observability refers to the ability to infer the internal state of a system through data such as logs, metrics, and traces. It is crucial for ensuring the reliability of dynamic distributed systems and is applied in microservice fault diagnosis, performance optimization, and compliance monitoring.

Common challenges include the complexity of distributed tracing, making it difficult to track request flows across services; the problem of data explosion, leading to challenges in managing massive logs and metrics; tool fragmentation, resulting in inconsistent integration of different components; increased resource overhead; lack of context correlation, affecting root cause analysis; and team skill gaps hindering effective implementation.

Implementing observability delivers significant application value, such as accelerating fault MTTR, optimizing resource utilization, enhancing application reliability, supporting business continuity, and improving user experience.
