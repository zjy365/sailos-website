  "content": "Cloud-native applications run in cloud environments based on container and microservice architectures, and their security is crucial because the distributed nature makes them vulnerable to zero-day vulnerabilities and configuration errors, commonly found in DevOps and hybrid cloud deployment scenarios.\n\nCore components include Identity and Access Management (IAM), network policy isolation (such as Kubernetes Network Policies), and continuous vulnerability scanning. These features implement end-to-end encryption and intrusion detection, ensuring applications defend against lateral movement and data breaches, and enhancing resilience and compliance.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy a service mesh (e.g., Istio) to enable mTLS authentication. 2. Configure strict least privilege access control. 3. Regularly automate scanning and audit logs. Business values include reducing losses from security incidents by over 50%, enhancing data protection, and supporting regulatory compliance such as GDPR."
