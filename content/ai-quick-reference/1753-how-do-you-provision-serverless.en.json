  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure provisioning using code definitions, while serverless infrastructure leverages cloud services like AWS Lambda to run applications without managing servers. This approach is vital for scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency, commonly applied in event-driven architectures, microservices, and rapid API deployments. It reduces manual errors and enhances agility in dynamic environments.\n\nCore components include IaC tools such as Terraform or Serverless Framework, featuring declarative syntax and version control for reusable configurations. These tools manage serverless elements like functions, triggers, and APIs, enabling consistent deployments. This integration supports continuous delivery pipelines, improving DevOps practices and reducing operational overhead, while fostering automated scaling and multi-cloud consistency.\n\nTo implement, first choose an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform). Define serverless resources in code files (using HCL or YAML), specifying functions, triggers, and policies. Apply the configuration via CLI commands and automate testing. Typical scenarios include deploying backend services with inherent scalability. This process delivers business value through cost savings, faster time-to-market, and resilient infrastructure via reproducible setups."
