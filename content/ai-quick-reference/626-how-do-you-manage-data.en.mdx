Managing data in a multi-cloud environment refers to coordinating the storage, access, security, and governance of data across multiple public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud platforms. Its importance lies in avoiding vendor lock-in, optimizing costs and performance, and enhancing business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities. Typical applications include distributed applications, data localization compliance, high-performance workload optimization, and resource elastic scaling scenarios.

Core strategies include unified data discovery and metadata management (establishing a global catalog), storage abstraction layers (such as object storage interfaces, data fabric) to enable location-independent access, cross-cloud data migration and synchronization tools, consistent access control policies and security encryption mechanisms, and unified monitoring and policy enforcement engines (e.g., via Open Policy Agent). Leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automation to simplify deployment is crucial.

Implementation steps typically involve: 1) Inventorying existing data locations and classifications; 2) Selecting unified management tools or platforms (such as storage abstraction solutions or cloud-native distributed databases); 3) Defining global data governance policies (security, compliance, retention); 4) Establishing cross-cloud data flow pipelines; 5) Deploying automated monitoring and enforcement frameworks. Business value is reflected in greater flexibility and resilience, reduced compliance risks, significant cost-saving potential, and improved operational efficiency.
