Containers are lightweight virtualization units used to encapsulate applications and their dependencies, enabling consistency and portability. In a microservices architecture, containers support independent deployment, isolation, and scaling of services, enhancing agility and resource efficiency. They are suitable for cloud-native development, DevOps practices, and efficient deployment scenarios.

Core components include image management, resource isolation, and runtime consistency. Technologies like Docker use cgroups and namespaces to achieve environmental isolation. Characteristically, each microservice runs in a dedicated container, simplifying development and deployment processes, facilitating automated CI/CD, elastic scaling, and fault isolation, while reducing resource consumption and maintenance complexity.

Their application value lies in providing efficient service encapsulation and runtime management, ensuring the portability, high availability, and cost optimization of microservices. Containers support rapid iteration, elastic scaling, and fault recovery, significantly enhancing system stability and business response speed.
