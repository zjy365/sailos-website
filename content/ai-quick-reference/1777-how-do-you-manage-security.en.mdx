Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure through code, ensuring automation, consistency, and traceability. Its importance lies in reducing human errors and enhancing security compliance; application scenarios include cloud environments and Kubernetes clusters, suitable for rapid deployment and large-scale operation and maintenance.

Core components include version control systems (such as Git) and CI/CD pipelines, with features like declarative configuration enabling automated updates. The principle is to integrate security patches into code templates and detect vulnerabilities through continuous scanning tools. In practice, this facilitates rapid response to security threats, with impacts including reduced operational risks and improved compliance.

Management steps: 1. Integrate automated scanning tools (such as Trivy or OpenSCAP) in CI/CD to detect vulnerabilities; 2. Regularly update IaC code to incorporate the latest patches; 3. Automate deployment testing and rollback mechanisms. A typical scenario is regular security audits; business values include reducing vulnerability risks and ensuring business continuity.
