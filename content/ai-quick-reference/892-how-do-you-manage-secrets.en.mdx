In a cloud-native environment, key management is crucial, such as using tools like HashiCorp Vault to ensure the secure storage and access of secrets like API keys and passwords. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches, applicable to microservice scenarios in Kubernetes clusters, and supporting the zero-trust security model.

Core features of Vault include secret engines (e.g., KV storage), dynamic certificate generation, policy-based access control, and integrated audit logging. In practical applications, Vault Agent or Sidecar is used to automatically inject secrets into container Pods, supporting dynamic rotation and native Kubernetes integration, which significantly improves the efficiency of secret protection and reduces human errors.

Implementation steps: 1) Deploy and initialize Vault; 2) Configure engines and policies; 3) Install K8s Injector using Helm; 4) Add Annotations in Pod definitions to reference secrets. A typical scenario is database credential rotation, with business values including compliance adaptation and risk reduction.
