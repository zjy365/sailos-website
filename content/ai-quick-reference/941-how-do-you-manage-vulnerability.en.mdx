Managing cloud-native application vulnerability scanning is a critical practice for ensuring their security. It involves automated detection of known security weaknesses in container images, Kubernetes configurations, and dependency libraries. Its importance lies in preventing attacks that exploit vulnerabilities, especially in CI/CD pipelines with rapid iterations and distributed deployment environments, which can significantly reduce the risks of supply chain attacks and data breaches. Application scenarios span the entire lifecycle of development, deployment, and operation.

The core is layered scanning: image scanning (analyzing Dockerfile and base image vulnerabilities), dependency scanning (checking application libraries such as OS packages and language packages), infrastructure as code scanning (IaC such as K8s YAML/Helm Charts compliance and security configurations), and runtime scanning (monitoring container behavior). Features include automated integration with CI/CD toolchains (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI), support for multiple repositories (container registries such as Harbor, Docker Hub), and linkage with Kubernetes runtime security platforms (e.g., Falco, Sysdig).

Implementation steps: First, embed image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair) in the CI pipeline to block images with high-risk vulnerabilities from entering the registry. Second, scan deployment manifests to ensure secure configurations. Finally, continuously monitor container activities and new vulnerability disclosures during runtime. Typical scenarios include CI/CD gatekeeping and regular cluster audits. Business value lies in reducing the cost of security incidents, accelerating compliance speed, and enhancing software supply chain resilience.
