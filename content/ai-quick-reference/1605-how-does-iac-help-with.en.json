  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure using code, ensuring deployment consistency and repeatability. Its importance lies in eliminating manual errors and discrepancies, providing a predictable environment. Application scenarios include cloud platform automation and DevOps pipelines, supporting reliable and efficient resource management.\n\nThe core components of IaC are configuration files (such as Terraform or Ansible scripts) and version control systems, with features including automation, traceability, and scalability. In practical applications, it enables automated provisioning through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), impacting improved resource utilization, reduced configuration drift, and enhanced cross-environment reliability.\n\nImplementation steps include writing declarative code, storing it in version control, and integrating CI/CD tools for automated deployment. A typical scenario is consistent deployment across multiple environments. The business value is reducing error rates, saving costs and time, ensuring rapid recovery of repeatable deployments, and enhancing maintainability."
