Cloud-native environment refers to an application architecture based on cloud computing, containerization, and microservices, emphasizing elastic scaling and automation. Its importance lies in supporting dynamic resource management and real-time data collection required for high-performance monitoring, applied in large-scale, distributed system scenarios such as microservice monitoring and agile deployment.

The core of this environment includes container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), observability components (e.g., Prometheus for metric collection, Jaeger for distributed tracing), and automated log aggregation. Features such as end-to-end visibility and self-healing capabilities significantly improve monitoring accuracy, enabling rapid problem localization and performance optimization, which impacts operational efficiency.

Implementation steps include integrating APM tools into CI/CD pipelines and configuring real-time alerts. Typical scenarios include automated performance diagnosis, and the business value lies in accelerating fault response, reducing downtime, and optimizing resource utilization, ultimately enhancing user experience and operational cost-effectiveness.
