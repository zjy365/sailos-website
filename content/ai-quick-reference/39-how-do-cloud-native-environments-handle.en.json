  "content": "Cloud-native environments handle storage for large-scale applications through containerization and dynamic resource management, ensuring data persistence, high availability, and elastic scalability to support high-throughput real-time application scenarios such as big data analytics and AI training.\n\nIts core components include Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), and StorageClasses, combined with distributed storage systems like Ceph or cloud service object storage. These elements provide dynamic provisioning, snapshot, and failure recovery capabilities, optimizing performance and reducing operational overhead, and are widely used in areas such as database clusters and log management.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Use PVC to declare application storage requirements. 2. Configure StorageClass to enable automatic volume provisioning. 3. Integrate redundant storage solutions. Business value: Improve system reliability, support infinite scalability, reduce costs, and accelerate iteration."
