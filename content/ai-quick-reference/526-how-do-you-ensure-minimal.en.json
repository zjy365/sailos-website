  "content": "Minimal downtime deployment involves almost uninterrupted user access when updating microservices, improving application availability and business continuity, especially in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes for high-frequency release scenarios.\n\nCore strategies include blue-green deployment (running old and new versions in parallel), rolling update (gradually replacing instances), and canary release (testing with small traffic), relying on the principles of health checks and error monitoring. In practical applications, configuring the maxUnavailable parameter of the Deployment object in Kubernetes controls the fault domain; this enhances deployment reliability, supports continuous delivery, and reduces production risks.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Build and test new container images. 2. Configure Kubernetes rolling update strategy. 3. Gradually route traffic to new instances. 4. Monitor metrics and automatically roll back if necessary. Typically used for feature releases or patch deployments, the business values include 100% availability, enhanced user experience, and reduced revenue loss."
