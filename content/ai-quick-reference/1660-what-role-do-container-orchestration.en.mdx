Container orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes) play a central role as the automation management layer in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud-native environments. They ensure the automation of deployment, scaling, and recovery of containerized applications, with their importance lying in enhancing efficiency, reliability, and environmental consistency. Application scenarios include continuous deployment of microservices architectures and resource management in hybrid cloud environments, supporting rapid business iteration.

Core components include schedulers, controllers, and API servers, which are used to define and execute the state of business workloads; features are manifested in declarative configuration and self-healing capabilities. In IaC, tools like Terraform define infrastructure, and orchestration tools execute container lifecycles to achieve end-to-end version control. Practical applications reduce manual errors, with impacts including standardizing cloud-native architectures, promoting DevOps practices, and improving team collaboration efficiency.

In application, orchestration tools convert IaC code into runnable container services, manage resource allocation and health checks. Their value lies in achieving high scalability, disaster recovery, and cost optimization, such as supporting peak traffic through automated scaling.
