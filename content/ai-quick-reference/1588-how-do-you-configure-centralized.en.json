  "content": "Centralized log management is crucial in Kubernetes for collecting, storing, and analyzing application and system logs scattered across numerous Pods. It provides a unified view for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security auditing, serving as the cornerstone of cloud-native observability.\n\nThe core architecture includes log collection agents (e.g., Fluentd, Fluent Bit), log transmission mechanisms (e.g., Kafka), central storage (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki), and visualization interfaces (e.g., Kibana, Grafana). Agents are deployed as DaemonSets to collect logs from node log directories or container standard output streams, process them, and forward to the backend. Features include high throughput, label association, and flexible parsing and filtering.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy log collectors (e.g., Fluent Bit DaemonSet). 2. Configure collection rules (input sources, parsers, filters). 3. Set output destinations (e.g., Elasticsearch endpoints or Loki URL). 4. Deploy storage and visualization components. 5. Verify log flow and queries. This solution significantly improves troubleshooting efficiency and supports real-time monitoring and compliance auditing."
