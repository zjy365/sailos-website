  "content": "Cloud-native development enhances application agility through containerization and microservice architecture. Legacy system integration allows organizations to gradually migrate to cloud-native environments while protecting existing investments, avoiding business disruptions, and is suitable for enterprise digital transformation such as upgrading IT systems in finance or manufacturing industries.\n\nCore components include API gateways (e.g., Istio or Kong) and service adapters, enabling loosely coupled communication. In practice, microservices call legacy systems through RESTful APIs or event-driven mechanisms, improving interoperability, promoting system modernization, and reducing technical debt.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Evaluate legacy interfaces; 2. Define unified API protocols; 3. Deploy the adapter layer; 4. Gradually migrate functions. Typical scenarios include e-commerce integrating inventory systems. Business values include reducing migration costs, enhancing resilience, and accelerating innovation speed."
