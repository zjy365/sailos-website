Automated deployment automatically executes building, testing, and releasing through standardized processes, significantly improving the delivery speed and reliability of containerized applications. Its importance lies in supporting continuous delivery, which is suitable for cloud-native scenarios requiring frequent iterations.

Core components include CI/CD pipelines, container registries, and orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes). The deployment process is triggered by code changes: the pipeline automatically builds container images and pushes them to the registry, and the orchestration platform executes rolling updates or blue-green deployments based on declarative configurations to ensure zero-downtime releases.

Implementation steps: 1. Submit code to trigger the pipeline; 2. Automatically build container images and scan for vulnerabilities; 3. Push images to a private registry; 4. The orchestration platform pulls new images and gradually replaces old containers; 5. Monitor health status and automatically roll back faulty versions. This process shortens the deployment cycle by more than 80% and reduces the risk of human errors.
