  "content": "Configuring cloud-native deployment strategies requires adjusting controller definitions and service governance on platforms like Kubernetes. This enables zero-downtime updates, rapid rollbacks, and risk control, suitable for scenarios such as blue-green deployment and canary release.\n\nCore components include Deployment/Service/Ingress controllers and HPA. The release process is controlled by adjusting the number of replicas, traffic weight rules (e.g., Service Mesh or Ingress Annotation), and rolling update parameters. GitOps tools (such as Argo CD) implement declarative management of policies, reducing human errors.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Define the environment (namespace/cluster); 2) Use Helm/Kustomize to manage deployment manifests; 3) Configure policies: blue-green deployment requires two sets of parallel Deployments and traffic switching through Service; canary release involves gradually increasing the percentage of new version Pod replicas and setting traffic比例 with Istio; 4) Integrate monitoring and automated testing for verification. This process improves release reliability and business resilience."
