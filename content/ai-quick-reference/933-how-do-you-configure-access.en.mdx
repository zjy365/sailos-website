In a cloud-native environment, configuring access control policies is a critical process for achieving secure and compliant operations. Cloud-native involves containerization (such as Docker), dynamic orchestration (such as Kubernetes), and microservice architecture, while access control policies prevent unauthorized operations by defining who can access which resources. Its importance lies in protecting sensitive data and services from vulnerabilities, with application scenarios including inter-service communication and data privacy management in multi-cloud deployments.

The core components include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies, identity providers (such as OIDC integration), and service mesh authorization mechanisms (such as Istio's AuthorizationPolicy). Features encompass fine-grained permissions, dynamic policy updates, and audit logs; in practical applications, organizations implement the principle of least privilege by restricting user or service permissions, for example, limiting Pod access to APIs in Kubernetes to enhance system reliability and reduce the impact of the attack surface.

Configuration steps: first, assess resource boundaries; second, define roles and permissions (such as creating Role/ClusterRole in K8s); third, bind to identities (using RoleBinding); finally, test and monitor access logs. Typical scenarios apply to secure interactions between microservices; business values include enhancing security posture, complying with regulations such as GDPR, and reducing operational costs through automation.
