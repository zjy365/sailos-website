Blue-green deployment is a software deployment strategy that uses two parallel environments (blue for the current version and green for the new version) to achieve uninterrupted updates. By isolating testing and quickly switching traffic, it ensures zero-downtime deployment, enhances system reliability and user experience, and is widely used in cloud-native architectures such as high-availability web services.

Integrating automation into blue-green deployment offers core advantages including automated testing, one-click traffic switching, and rollback mechanisms. Features like scripted deployment processes reduce human errors, and continuous monitoring ensures real-time health checks. This significantly accelerates release cycles, reduces risks, improves deployment consistency, and helps enterprises implement efficient CI/CD pipelines and fault recovery.

The value brought by automation includes缩短上线时间, enhanced business continuity, and reduced costs. Typical benefits such as faster validation of new features and support for instant rollbacks to maintain service stability, thereby increasing team productivity and optimizing customer satisfaction.
