  "content": "Cloud-native environments process massive amounts of data generated by IoT devices through containerization and dynamic orchestration technologies. Its importance lies in achieving high elastic scalability and low latency, making it suitable for scenarios such as smart cities and industrial IoT to support real-time analytics.\n\nCore components include microservices architecture (e.g., data processing microservices), Kubernetes orchestration, and message middleware (e.g., Kafka). Features include automatic fault recovery and horizontal scaling. In practical applications, it is used for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nImplementation steps: data collection (via protocols like MQTT), stream processing (using Flink for real-time computing in Kubernetes), and storage (time-series databases such as InfluxDB). Business values include immediate decision support and resource optimization, with a typical scenario being remote device monitoring."
