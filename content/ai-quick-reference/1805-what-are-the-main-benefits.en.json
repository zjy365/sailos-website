  "content": "Container technology packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable units, while cloud-native development refers to building scalable, resilient distributed applications in cloud computing environments. The combination of the two is crucial, especially suitable for microservices architectures and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) scenarios, which can significantly improve application delivery efficiency and flexibility.\n\nCore advantages include: 1. Environmental consistency, eliminating the issue of \"\"working in the development environment but failing in the production environment\"\"; 2. Resource isolation and efficient utilization, as containers share the operating system kernel, booting faster with lower resource overhead than virtual machines; 3. Support for microservices decoupling to accelerate iteration; 4. Implementation of automatic scaling, self-healing, and declarative configuration management with orchestration tools like Kubernetes, enhancing system resilience.\n\nPractical value is reflected in: accelerating business launch (minute-level deployment), improving development and operations collaboration efficiency (DevOps practices), optimizing cloud resource costs (on-demand scaling), ensuring seamless migration across cloud/hybrid cloud environments, and ultimately supporting enterprises in quickly responding to market changes."
