Cloud-native data pipelines involve building and managing data processing workflows on cloud platforms, leveraging technologies such as containerization and microservices to achieve efficient data transmission, transformation, and analysis. Their importance lies in supporting both real-time and batch data streams, providing elastic scalability and high availability in scenarios like IoT and AI analytics to enhance data processing resilience and business response speed.

The core components include data ingestion (e.g., Kafka or message queues), processing engines (e.g., Spark or Flink), and storage layers (e.g., object storage or databases), all containerized and deployed on Kubernetes clusters to ensure automatic scaling. Features include an event-driven architecture and CI/CD integration, enabling low latency and fault tolerance. In practical applications, they drive real-time monitoring, machine learning pipelines, optimize resource utilization, and accelerate enterprises' data insight transformation.

Processing steps include: defining requirements, selecting tools (e.g., Argo or Airflow for orchestration); containerizing components and deploying them to Kubernetes platforms; integrating log monitoring and security policies. A typical scenario is real-time fraud detection, which can automate data stream processing. The business value is reducing operational overhead by over 50%, improving processing speed and reliability, and facilitating agile innovation and data-driven decision-making.
