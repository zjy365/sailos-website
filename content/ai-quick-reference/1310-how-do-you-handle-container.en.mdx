Timely detection and remediation of container image vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipelines are crucial as they prevent vulnerable images from entering production environments, mitigate security risks, and safeguard application supply chain security. Early vulnerability remediation significantly reduces data breaches and the attack surface.

The core lies in integrating automated vulnerability scanning tools (such as Trivy, Clair, Aqua) into critical stages of the pipeline (e.g., post-build or pre-deployment) and enforcing security policies. Key features include: 1) Setting scanning thresholds (e.g., severity levels), with pipeline progression blocked upon failure to meet them; 2) Generating detailed reports to locate problematic layers and packages; 3) Automating workflows for pulling updated base images or applying patches; 4) Ensuring deployment security by combining image signing and admission control.

Processing steps: 1) Scanning: Inserting an image scanning step during the pipeline build phase using lightweight scanners. 2) Evaluation and blocking: Defining policies for critical vulnerabilities (e.g., failure if CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities exist) to automatically stop the deployment of high-risk images. 3) Remediation and rebuilding: Identifying vulnerability sources (e.g., outdated base images), updating dependencies or applying patches, and triggering pipeline rebuilds. 4) Runtime validation: Using admission controllers (e.g., Kyverno, OPA) during deployment to secondary intercept non-compliant images. 5) Continuous monitoring: Using container security platforms post-deployment to monitor for newly emerging vulnerabilities. Value: Accelerating the vulnerability remediation cycle, automating compliance governance, and avoiding production incidents and reputational damage caused by vulnerabilities.
