IaC tools (such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation) automate infrastructure configuration through code. Configuring auto-scaling for containerized applications is crucial, as it dynamically adjusts the number of resource instances based on load, ensuring high availability and cost efficiency. This is common in cloud-native scenarios for handling traffic, such as microservice deployments.

Core components include defining scaling policies (e.g., Kubernetes HPA) that automatically trigger replica increases or decreases based on metrics (CPU or memory). In practice, deployment scripts are coded via IaC tools to enable unattended scaling, enhancing system elasticity and performance, significantly optimizing cloud resource utilization. The impacts include reducing downtime risks and improving development efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Use tools to define rules (e.g., Kubernetes YAML specifying HPA metrics); 2. Encode policies in IaC tools and integrate with monitoring; 3. Deploy and test. A typical scenario is e-commerce applications responding to peak traffic. The business value lies in automated operation and maintenance, reduced overhead, and guaranteed user experience.
