Decentralized data management refers to the practice in a microservices architecture where each service independently maintains its own private database instead of sharing a centralized storage. Its importance lies in enhancing service autonomy, improving system resilience and scalability, and avoiding single points of failure; application scenarios include e-commerce and financial systems, supporting flexible data processing and distributed deployment.

The core components include service private storage, API gateways, and event-driven mechanisms; features involve data isolation, eventual consistency, and domain-driven design principles. In practical applications, it optimizes performance, reduces coupling, and handles transaction coordination through the SAGA pattern; it has a profound impact on the cloud-native domain, promoting agile development and elastic scaling.

The application of this concept simplifies data access and accelerates iterative updates; its value lies in reducing costs, supporting large-scale expansion and business continuity, ultimately improving system responsiveness and competitiveness.
