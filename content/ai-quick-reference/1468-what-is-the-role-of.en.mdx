Cloud-native observability is the ability to real-time monitor the status of cloud-native applications through tools such as logs, metrics, and traces, which is crucial for ensuring application uptime. Its importance lies in providing proactive insights, quickly diagnosing failures, maintaining high availability in dynamic containerized and microservice environments, and is applicable to Kubernetes management and modern cloud deployment scenarios.

The core components include logging (for anomaly analysis), metrics monitoring (such as CPU utilization), and distributed tracing (visualizing request flows). These features support real-time visibility and end-to-end diagnosis, shorten Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) by quickly capturing performance anomalies, significantly enhance system resilience, and optimize resource efficiency in complex deployments.

Its application value lies in proactively detecting potential issues and triggering automatic alerts, thereby reducing downtime risks, ensuring business continuity and excellent user experience, and ultimately achieving stable service delivery and Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance.
