Hybrid cloud deployment monitoring refers to the unified monitoring of applications and infrastructure distributed across public and private clouds to ensure performance, availability, and security. Its importance lies in providing cross-environment visibility and optimizing resource utilization, suitable for high-availability scenarios in enterprise hybrid IT architectures such as the financial or manufacturing industries.

Core components include agent collectors (e.g., Prometheus Exporter), time-series databases (e.g., Prometheus), and visualization tools (e.g., Grafana). Features include multi-source data integration, real-time analysis, and metric aggregation. The principle is to uniformly collect logs, metrics, and tracing data through APIs and agents, with practical applications in monitoring container performance and service networks in Kubernetes clusters to enhance overall reliability.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy a unified platform such as Datadog or Elastic Stack; 2. Configure cloud service API connections (e.g., AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor); 3. Set up cross-cloud agents to collect data; 4. Define alert rules and dashboards. Business values include accelerating fault location, reducing downtime by 30%-50%, and optimizing cost efficiency.
