Data encryption converts data into unreadable ciphertext through algorithms and is a key mechanism for protecting data security and privacy in cloud storage. Its importance lies in preventing unauthorized access, data leakage, and compliance violations, and it is applicable to high-risk scenarios where sensitive information such as personal identity, financial, and health data is stored.

The core includes transmission encryption (such as TLS to protect data transmission) and encryption at rest (such as AES-256 to protect stored data), with decryption permission controlled through key management systems. In practical applications, cloud storage services like AWS S3 enable encryption by default, which can reduce the risk of data theft, significantly enhance the security posture, and support regulations (such as GDPR), thereby reducing the frequency and cost of enterprise security incidents.

Data encryption ensures data confidentiality and integrity in cloud storage, enhances user trust, and provides reliable protection value for businesses. Its application enables secure data processing and sharing, such as maintaining data immutability during compliance audits, directly reducing security risks and safeguarding corporate reputation.
