Cloud-native environments are based on containerization and orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes, emphasizing automation and scalability. Security auditing is crucial in this environment to ensure compliance and detect threats in real-time, applied in multi-tenant clusters and service meshes to prevent data breaches and attack infiltration.

Core components include monitoring tools like Prometheus for collecting metrics, Grafana for visualization, and security auditing tools such as Falco for analyzing container behavior or Elastic Security for aggregating logs. The principle involves detecting abnormal activities through rule engines and machine learning, such as unauthorized API calls or configuration vulnerabilities. In practical applications, these tools help audit user operations, network traffic, and event logs, significantly improving the efficiency of compliance reporting and reducing the risk of false positives.

Implementation steps: First, deploy the monitoring stack and configure audit policies; second, integrate a log management system like Loki; finally, set up an alert response mechanism. Typical scenarios include auditing Kubernetes control plane activities or container escape incidents. The business value is to accelerate threat response, reduce security costs, and enhance compliance credentials such as meeting GDPR requirements.
