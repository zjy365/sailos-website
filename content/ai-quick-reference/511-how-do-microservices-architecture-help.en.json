  "content": "Microservices architecture enhances system resilience by decomposing applications into independently deployable small service units. Its importance lies in improving fault isolation and maintainability, making it suitable for scenarios requiring high availability such as e-commerce and finance.\n\nCore components include autonomous services, lightweight API communication (e.g., REST/gRPC), and containerized deployment. Features like fault tolerance and auto-scaling ensure that single-point failures are isolated, and service instances can be restarted or replaced independently, significantly reducing downtime risks.\n\nImplementation steps include: deploying services independently to reduce the impact of single-point failures; integrating health checks and automatic recovery mechanisms; dynamically scaling to handle traffic peaks; and combining CI/CD pipelines to quickly fix defects. A typical scenario is implementing multi-region redundancy in cloud-native environments, bringing business value such as 99.99% uptime."
