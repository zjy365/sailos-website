  "content": "Orchestration in cloud-native development refers to the automated management and coordination of the lifecycle of containerized applications, ensuring the efficient operation of distributed systems. Its importance lies in supporting the elasticity and reliability of microservices architectures, applied in scenarios such as continuous deployment and dynamic resource optimization.\n\nThe core components include service scheduling, auto-scaling, load balancing, and fault recovery, with the principle based on declarative configuration to achieve dynamic resource allocation. Features encompass automatic horizontal scaling and self-healing capabilities. In practical applications, tools like Kubernetes drive the evolution of the cloud-native ecosystem, enhancing development and运维 efficiency through seamless deployment.\n\nThe value of orchestration lies in automating operational processes, significantly reducing costs, ensuring high application availability, and helping enterprises iterate quickly and respond to business needs at scale."
