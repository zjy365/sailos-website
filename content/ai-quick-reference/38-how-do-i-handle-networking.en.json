  "content": "In a cloud-native development environment, network processing refers to managing communication between containers and microservices to ensure reliability, scalability, and security. Its importance lies in supporting resilient application architectures, enabling dynamic service discovery, load balancing, and failover, with application scenarios including large-scale microservice deployments and hybrid cloud environments.\n\nCore components include Container Network Interface (CNI), network policies, and service meshes (e.g., Istio). Features encompass automated configuration, policy-driven routing, and security isolation. In practical applications, Kubernetes provides a network abstraction layer, implementing IP allocation and connectivity through CNI plugins (such as Calico or Flannel), which simplifies multi-cluster governance and enhances overall system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: First, deploy CNI plugins to manage the underlying network; second, configure network policies to control traffic access permissions; then integrate service meshes to monitor inter-service communication (e.g., Istio); finally, apply ingress controllers to handle external APIs. A typical scenario is high-traffic microservice systems. Business values include improving application performance, enhancing security, optimizing operational efficiency, and reducing latency costs."
