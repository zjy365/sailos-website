  "content": "Serverless computing is a cloud service model where developers do not need to manage server infrastructure, and resource provisioning is handled automatically. It is crucial in cloud-native application development, simplifying运维 (operations and maintenance) and supporting event-driven scenarios such as microservices and API processing, thereby improving development efficiency.\n\nCore features include automatic scaling, pay-as-you-go, and event-driven architecture principles, enabling immediate response through Function as a Service (FaaS). In practical applications, it promotes elastic deployment and agile iteration within the cloud-native ecosystem, reducing management burdens, optimizing performance, and driving DevOps practices for continuous delivery.\n\nThis technology plays a key role by accelerating innovation cycles, reducing operational costs, and supporting high availability. It directly implements cloud-native principles such as elasticity and scalability, providing real-time responses and value optimization for businesses."
