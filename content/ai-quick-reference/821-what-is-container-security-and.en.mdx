Container security involves protecting the lifecycle of containerized applications, including the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of images, runtimes, and orchestration platforms. In cloud-native environments, due to the combination of application elasticity, distributed characteristics, and automated deployment, container security is crucial as it prevents data breaches, service disruptions, and supports compliance requirements across multiple cloud environments.

Key components include image scanning (to detect vulnerabilities), runtime protection (to monitor behavioral anomalies), network policies (to restrict access), and secrets management (to encrypt sensitive data). In cloud-native stacks such as Kubernetes, these functions are implemented through automated security tools to enhance environmental resilience; they integrate with CI/CD pipelines, reduce the attack surface, improve application reliability, and drive risk reduction in cloud-native innovation.

Its value lies in ensuring end-to-end security from development to production by integrating security scanning into DevOps workflows, reducing human errors and potential threats. Practical applications include adding policy checks in container registries to enhance business continuity and data protection, ultimately increasing customer trust and operational efficiency.
