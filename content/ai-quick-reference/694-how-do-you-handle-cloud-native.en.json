  "content": "Cloud-native data storage provides dynamically scalable storage solutions for video streaming applications, addressing the high concurrency and low latency requirements of processing large volumes of real-time video content. It is suitable for scenarios such as live streaming platforms and video-on-demand services, ensuring stable and efficient user experience.\n\nIts core components include Kubernetes StatefulSets for managing stateful workloads, Persistent Volumes (PVs/PVCs) for ensuring data persistence, and cloud object storage (e.g., Amazon S3) for handling video file data lakes. Features like automatic failover, data sharding, and horizontal scaling support real-time encoding and distributed processing, with impacts including improved system resilience and optimized resource costs.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy a Kubernetes cluster integrated with object storage services; 2. Configure data partitioning and CDN caching to reduce latency; 3. Utilize HPA for automatic scaling to handle traffic fluctuations. Typical scenarios support multi-user high-definition streaming, and the business value lies in enhancing reliability and operational efficiency while reducing infrastructure costs."
