Cloud-native environments, based on containerization and orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes), are a key approach in modern cloud computing. They optimize the scalability and elasticity of application deployment, are widely used in microservices and continuous delivery scenarios, and enhance team agility and resource efficiency.

Its core includes container resource isolation, auto-scaling mechanisms (such as HPA), and declarative resource management. Through node pool scheduling and namespace quotas, Kubernetes ensures on-demand resource allocation. The microservices architecture supports independent scaling, reduces resource waste, significantly improves cluster utilization and fault recovery capabilities, and lowers cloud expenses.

Implementation steps: containerize applications and deploy them to Kubernetes; set pod resource requests and limits; enable auto-scaling rules; monitor resource metrics and optimize configurations. Typical business values include saving up to 30% of cloud costs, enhancing application performance and response speed, supporting elastic loads, and enabling rapid iterative development.
