Integrating performance and load testing into CI/CD pipelines is crucial as it continuously verifies whether applications meet performance requirements before deployment, identifies potential bottlenecks, and prevents performance degradation. This ensures the reliability and responsiveness of software under real user traffic, making it suitable for cloud-native application scenarios with high-frequency releases and high availability requirements.

Its core components include: integration of automation tools (such as JMeter, Locust, k6), defining production-like test scenarios (benchmark testing, load testing, stress testing), resource monitoring (application and infrastructure metrics), and setting clear performance gates (such as response time thresholds, error rates). Testing is typically conducted in a staging environment that mimics the production environment, and results need to be automatically analyzed and linked to pipeline decisions (such as automatic failure or alerts).

Implementation steps: 1) Select appropriate performance testing tools and script scenarios; 2) Add a dedicated performance testing phase in the pipeline; 3) Configure automated test environment provisioning; 4) Execute tests and capture key metrics; 5) Analyze results and compare them with predefined standards; 6) Decide whether to proceed with or halt the release based on the results. This brings significant value such as rapid feedback, reduced production risks, improved user experience, and enhanced operational efficiency.
