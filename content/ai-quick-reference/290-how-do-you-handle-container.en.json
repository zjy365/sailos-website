  "content": "A container registry is a service platform for centralized storage and management of container images, such as Docker Registry or solutions from cloud service providers. Its importance lies in ensuring image discoverability, version consistency, and security, providing a foundation for automated deployment. Application scenarios include storing, pulling, and deploying containerized applications in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to improve efficiency and reliability.\n\nCore components include an image storage layer, API interfaces, access control mechanisms (such as Role-Based Access Control - RBAC), and a version tagging system. Features include high availability design, image signing, and security scanning. In practical applications, registries integrate with orchestration tools like Kubernetes, supporting automated testing, rolling updates, and rollback mechanisms, significantly improving the deployment speed and resource utilization of cloud-native applications.\n\nImplementation steps include: selecting and configuring a private or public registry; integrating automated image building and pushing in CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions); setting RBAC policies and audit logs; monitoring image usage to optimize management. Typical scenarios involve automated release of microservices architectures. Business value includes accelerating deployment cycles (from days to hours), reducing human error rates, and enhancing system stability and compliance."
