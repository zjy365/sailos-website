  "content": "Microservices is a distributed architectural style that splits applications into independent small services communicating via networks. Handling network latency and reliability is crucial to avoid cascading failures and performance degradation, making it suitable for high-availability scenarios such as e-commerce and finance.\n\nCore mechanisms include retry strategies, circuit breakers (e.g., Hystrix), timeout settings, and service meshes (e.g., Istio), which reduce single-point failure risks through automated fault tolerance. In practical applications, these tools isolate problematic services in e-commerce order systems, enhancing system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Configure inter-service timeout periods to prevent blocking; 2) Add exponential backoff retry logic; 3) Deploy circuit breakers to detect and isolate faulty services; 4) Prioritize asynchronous message queue communication. This will optimize response time and enhance business continuity."
