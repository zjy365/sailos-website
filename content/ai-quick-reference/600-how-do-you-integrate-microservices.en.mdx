Microservices are small, loosely coupled services that are independently deployable, while Kubernetes is a platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Integrating the two is crucial as it provides declarative configuration, elastic scaling, self-healing, and service discovery, serving as a core scenario for implementing efficient and reliable cloud-native microservice architectures.

Key integration steps include: 1) Packaging each microservice and its dependencies into container images; 2) Defining Deployments or StatefulSets in Kubernetes to manage the lifecycle of Pod replicas for each microservice; 3) Creating Service resources as stable access endpoints with load balancing; 4) Configuring a unified external access entry and security rules via Ingress; 5) Setting up ConfigMaps and Secrets when needed. This integration significantly improves deployment density, resource utilization, and operational efficiency.

Practical steps involve: 1. Building Docker images for each microservice and pushing them to an image registry; 2. Writing Kubernetes manifests (YAML files), primarily Deployments (defining Pod replica counts and containers) and Services (defining network endpoints); 3. Deploying the manifests to the cluster using `kubectl apply -f`; 4. Verifying service discovery and access (typically via internal DNS `<service-name>.<namespace>`). Typical benefits include automated rolling updates, cross-service health checks, resource-based dynamic scaling, and efficient resource isolation management, which significantly reduce the operational complexity of distributed systems.
