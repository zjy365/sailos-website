Integrating legacy systems into modern CI/CD pipelines refers to the process of adapting old applications to be included in automated build, test, and deployment workflows through适配技术. Its importance lies in breaking down isolation, improving delivery speed and quality, and achieving unified operation and maintenance management. It is suitable for core business systems that rely on outdated technology stacks but still require continuous updates.

Core methods include: 1) Containerization encapsulation, packaging legacy applications into Docker images to isolate environmental dependencies; 2) API gateway bridging, wrapping old system interfaces through lightweight APIs to achieve standardized communication with new components; 3) Environment simulation and automated testing, using virtualization technology to simulate old environments and implement automated smoke testing. In practice, priority must be given to ensuring stability, and canary releases should be adopted to control risks.

Implementation steps:

1. Evaluation and decoupling: Identify reusable modules and separate shared dependencies such as databases.

2. Lightweight packaging: Encapsulate the application layer with containers and expose functions through an API gateway.

3. Phased pipeline: Establish an independent pipeline for the old system, triggering only key tests (such as interface verification).

4. Progressive delivery: Gradually replace old instances using blue-green deployment or traffic mirroring.

The business value is to reduce manual deployment time by more than 50% and lower the risk of production failures.
