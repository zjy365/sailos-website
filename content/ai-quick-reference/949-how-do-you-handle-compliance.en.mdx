In cloud-native environments, data sovereignty laws require data to be stored and processed in specific countries or regions, subject to local regulations such as GDPR or CPRA. Its importance lies in ensuring enterprises comply with privacy regulations, avoid fines, and protect user privacy, especially applicable to globally deployed application scenarios like cross-border microservice architectures.

Core components include data encryption, geographical location control (via Kubernetes namespace policies or Pod security policies), access permission management, and automatic audit mechanisms. It is characterized by using cloud-native tools (such as service meshes or compliance frameworks) to achieve data localization and secure transmission. In practical applications, it can reduce legal risks, support enterprises in compliant operations across multiple regions, and significantly enhance data protection and global business expansion capabilities.

Processing steps include: first, assessing applicable legal requirements; deploying regionalized storage (such as restricting the location of object storage); implementing tools (such as Kafka topic partitioning) to isolate data flows; and finally, continuous monitoring and auditing. A typical scenario is running critical data in sovereign cloud regions (such as China region); business values include avoiding fines, enhancing customer trust, and providing competitive advantages.
