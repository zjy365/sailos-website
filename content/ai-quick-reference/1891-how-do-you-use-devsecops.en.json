  "content": "DevSecOps seamlessly integrates security practices into the DevOps process, which is particularly crucial in cloud-native application development. It detects threats in the early lifecycle stages through automated security measures, reduces risks in complex cloud environments (such as microservices and containers), and is applied in continuous delivery pipelines to prevent distributed attacks.\n\nIts core includes shifting security left strategy, automated scanning (such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools), infrastructure-as-code security configuration, and continuous monitoring. By embedding security into CI/CD automation, this reduces the exposure time of vulnerabilities, enhances compliance and resilience in practical applications, and prevents the exposure of cloud-native components.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Integrate security tools into the CI/CD pipeline for scanning; 2. Perform automated testing during the development phase (such as Kubernetes configuration auditing); 3. Monitor runtime logs and threats; 4. Foster a culture of cross-functional collaboration within the team. The business value lies in reducing the cost of security incidents, increasing delivery speed, and ensuring business continuity."
