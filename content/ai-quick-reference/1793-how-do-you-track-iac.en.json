  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) uses code to define and manage infrastructure, tracked in version control systems (VCS) like Git. This ensures consistency, auditability, and reproducibility in cloud deployments, critical for environments like Kubernetes or serverless applications.\n\nIaC core components include declarative configuration files (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation), managed via VCS features such as branching, commits, and pull requests. This enables automated testing, deployment pipelines, and rollbacks, significantly reducing manual errors and enhancing scalability and compliance.\n\nTo track changes: Store IaC code in a Git repository; create branches for development; commit updates with clear messages; integrate CI/CD for automated validation and deployment. Business value includes reduced downtime and accelerated releases."
