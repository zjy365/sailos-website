Ensure that cloud-native applications comply with regulations and standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO 27001, which involves meeting data protection, privacy, and security requirements. This is crucial in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, as it can help avoid fines, protect user data, and enhance trust, applicable to sensitive application scenarios deployed on platforms like Kubernetes.

Core components include policy as code (e.g., implementing rules using Open Policy Agent), access control (such as RBAC and IAM), and security scanning tools (e.g., image vulnerability detection). These are integrated into CI/CD pipelines through automation to perform continuous compliance checks, reducing human errors; in practical applications, they can proactively prevent data leaks, improve the audit traceability of systems, and enhance operational efficiency.

Implementation steps include: 1. Assessing compliance requirements and mapping them to policies; 2. Deploying control measures, such as configuring policy engines and log monitoring in Kubernetes; 3. Conducting continuous audit reporting and risk mitigation. The business value lies in reducing non-compliance risks and costs, ensuring reliability, and enhancing market competitiveness.
