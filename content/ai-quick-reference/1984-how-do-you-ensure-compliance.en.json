  "content": "Cloud-native applications are built based on containerization and microservices architecture. In regulated industries such as finance or healthcare, ensuring compliance is crucial to adhere to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, avoid legal risks, and protect sensitive data; it is commonly seen in security deployment and data governance scenarios.\n\nIts core includes Kubernetes policy engines (such as OPA) and service meshes (such as Istio), implementing policy as code to achieve automated security controls, continuous monitoring of configurations and data flows. This impacts industries by reducing manual intervention, ensuring real-time compliance detection, and improving efficiency through automated tools.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Identify regulatory requirements and map them to technical standards. 2. Deploy policy controls, such as admission controllers and role-based access permissions. 3. Integrate compliance scanning into CI/CD pipelines. 4. Conduct regular audits and reporting. Typically used in financial services to automatically review data privacy, bringing business values such as reducing the risk of fines, enhancing trust, and optimizing costs."
