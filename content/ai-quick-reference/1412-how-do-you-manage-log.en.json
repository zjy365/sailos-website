  "content": "Managing log aggregation in a Kubernetes environment is crucial because containers are ephemeral and distributed, making traditional host-based log collection ineffective. It ensures centralized storage, retrieval, and analysis of application and system logs, which are indispensable for troubleshooting, security auditing, and performance monitoring.\n\nThe core lies in centralizing container logs from various nodes. Typically, a DaemonSet is used to deploy log collection agents (such as Fluentd, Filebeat) on each node to collect node and container logs, or a Sidecar container is used to run alongside the application container in the same Pod for application log collection. The collected logs are sent to a central log aggregation backend (such as Elasticsearch, Loki, Splunk, Cloud Logging/S3) for storage and are searched and displayed through visualization tools (such as Kibana, Grafana).\n\nPractical operation steps include: 1) Configure container applications to ensure logs are output to standard output/error streams (stdout/stderr) or volumes; 2) Select and deploy a log collection architecture (DaemonSet is the mainstream); 3) Configure the collection agent to identify log sources (container log files/stdout), parse, filter, and forward to the aggregation backend; 4) Deploy and configure the log storage system; 5) Use query and visualization tools to analyze logs. This provides a unified log view and significantly improves operational efficiency."
