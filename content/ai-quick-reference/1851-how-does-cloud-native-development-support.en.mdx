Cloud-native development inherently supports the core goals of DevOps—achieving continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automated operations—by providing a technical infrastructure based on containerization, microservices, and service meshes. It shortens development cycles, improves software delivery efficiency and quality, and is suitable for modern application scenarios requiring rapid iteration.

Its core components include containers (providing environment consistency), microservice architecture (enabling loose coupling and independent deployment), declarative APIs (such as Kubernetes orchestration), and continuous deployment toolchains. These features drive the automation of DevOps practices: container images serve as immutable units throughout the process; microservices support team autonomy and independent releases; infrastructure as code ensures environmental consistency; service meshes enhance observability and resilience. This significantly increases deployment frequency and system stability.

Practical implementation typically integrates the following steps to realize the DevOps process: 1) Packaging applications using containers; 2) Adopting Kubernetes for automated orchestration and scaling; 3) Integrating CI/CD pipelines to enable automated testing and deployment; 4) Implementing real-time feedback through logging, monitoring, and service meshes. Typical scenarios include blue-green deployments and automatic rollbacks. Its business value lies in shortening time-to-market, improving resource utilization, enhancing system reliability, and reducing operational complexity.
