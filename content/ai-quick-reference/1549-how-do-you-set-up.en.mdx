Multi-region observability ensures consistent and comprehensive monitoring views of performance, health, and anomalies for geographically distributed cloud-native applications (microservices, containers). Its core importance lies in ensuring high availability, enabling rapid fault localization, optimizing inter-region performance, and meeting compliance requirements, particularly applicable in scenarios such as disaster recovery, global load balancing, and data residency compliance.

The core components of implementing multi-region observability include: centralized data aggregation points (e.g., regional OpenTelemetry Collectors), global storage backends (databases supporting multi-region replication such as Cortex, Mimir, or cloud services), unified query layers (e.g., Thanos, VictoriaMetrics), and global visualization platforms (e.g., Grafana). The key is to use OpenTelemetry standards to collect distributed traces, metrics, and logs, unify data specifications and transmission, and configure region-aware alert routing to ensure alerts are handled by the nearest team.

Implementation steps: 1. Standardize data collection using OpenTelemetry; 2. Deploy Collectors in each region to send data to centralized storage; 3. Configure global storage (enabling multi-region replication); 4. Build global dashboards in visualization tools to ensure cross-region query capability; 5. Set up alert policies and routing rules based on region labels; 6. Verify data latency, integrity, and query efficiency to ensure compliance. The core value is to provide a single view to掌控全局状态, significantly accelerate MTTR, and optimize user experience.
