Cloud-native environments leverage cloud computing features (such as containerization and dynamic orchestration) to provide elastic scalability for applications. They ensure application availability in high-concurrency scenarios and are suitable for businesses with fluctuating demands, such as e-commerce or financial services.

Core components include Kubernetes' auto-scaling mechanisms, microservices architecture, and continuous deployment tools, which dynamically adjust resources through load monitoring. Features like observability and self-healing ensure the reliability and efficiency of scaling, enhancing operational automation and business resilience.

During implementation, first define resource metrics and configure the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to achieve on-demand scaling of Pod instances. Typical scenarios include handling traffic peaks, and business value is reflected in cost optimization, performance improvement, and enhanced user experience.
