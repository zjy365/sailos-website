In microservices architecture, inter-service communication security ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data transmission, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and data leakage. Its importance lies in protecting distributed systems from unauthorized access, applicable to highly sensitive scenarios in fields such as finance and e-commerce, and enhancing the reliability of the overall architecture.

The core components include transport layer encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL), mutual authentication (mTLS), API gateways (processing request filtering), service meshes (e.g., Istio for managing automatic security policies), and token validation (e.g., JWT or OAuth). These mechanisms ensure that only legitimate services interact through encrypted channels and identity authorization mechanisms, reducing the attack surface in practice and supporting the zero-trust security model.

Implementation steps: 1. Enable end-to-end TLS encryption for all communications. 2. Deploy a service mesh to implement automatic mTLS and policy management. 3. Integrate an API gateway for request validation and rate limiting. 4. Adopt token mechanisms (e.g., OAuth) for service authorization. A typical scenario is e-commerce order processing, with business values including enhancing data privacy, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and reducing business losses caused by security incidents.
