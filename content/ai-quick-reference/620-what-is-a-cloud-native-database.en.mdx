Cloud-native databases are data storage systems optimized for cloud environments, emphasizing elasticity, scalability, and service orientation in their design, based on containerization and microservice architectures. Their importance lies in supporting the efficient operation of modern applications such as real-time analytics and microservice workloads on cloud platforms, helping to achieve dynamic resource allocation and cost optimization.

Core features include distributed architecture, automatic scaling, high availability, and deep integration with container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes). In practical applications, such databases are suitable for scenarios requiring elastic data processing and horizontal scaling. Their impact is to enhance system reliability, performance, and management automation, thereby driving DevOps efficiency and the development of the cloud-native ecosystem.

In application, cloud-native databases enable agile deployment, continuous data backup, and low-latency access. Their value lies in reducing operational overhead, enhancing business resilience, and supporting innovative cloud services such as AI-driven analytics, driving digital transformation and growth.
