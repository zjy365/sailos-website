AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service provided by AWS that automates the management of cloud resources through code templates. Its importance lies in enabling version control, consistency, and repeatability of infrastructure. Application scenarios include automated deployment of complex environments (such as EC2, VPC), disaster recovery, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes.

The core components are CloudFormation templates (in JSON or YAML format), which include resource definitions, parameters, conditions, and outputs. Features support declarative configuration, resource dependency management, and automatic rollback. In practical applications, teams use it to quickly set up and test environments, improve cloud governance and auditability. The impacts include reducing manual errors and simplifying multi-region deployments.

To use CloudFormation for IaC: first, write a template to describe resource requirements; second, deploy the stack through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or API to create or update resources. Typical scenarios include configuring application stacks (such as networks and security groups). Business values are reflected in accelerating time-to-market, optimizing costs, and supporting auto-scaling.
