  "content": "A CI/CD pipeline refers to the process of automatically building, testing, and deploying software changes, which accelerates delivery and reduces errors. Data migration involves changing database structures or content to ensure synchronization with application versions. Its importance lies in maintaining data consistency, avoiding application disruptions, and is applied in scenarios such as releasing new features or database upgrades.\n\nThe core components include versioned migration scripts (such as SQL files), tools (such as Flyway or Liquibase), and integrating migration tasks in CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins). Features include automated execution, rollback capability, and atomic operations. The principle is that migrations are part of the build pipeline and executed sequentially. Practical applications reduce manual intervention and increase release frequency; impacts promote DevOps culture and enhance system reliability.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Write and test migration scripts, store them in version control. 2. Configure migration jobs in the CI/CD pipeline (such as GitLab CI stages). 3. Automatically execute and verify changes. 4. Define rollback mechanisms to handle failures. Typically, schema updates are accompanied by deployments; business values include shortening time-to-market, ensuring data integrity, and reducing risks."
