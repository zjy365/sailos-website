  "content": "Cloud-native development is an approach to building applications based on cloud services, emphasizing containerization, microservices, and continuous delivery to enhance the agility, scalability, and resilience of large-scale applications. By dynamically optimizing resources in cloud environments, it supports high-concurrency distributed systems such as e-commerce or financial applications, avoiding the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures.\n\nThe core of this development model lies in microservice decomposition, container packaging, and automated management through orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Its features include containers ensuring environmental consistency and orchestration engines handling deployment and scaling, enabling large applications to achieve self-healing and high availability. In practice, it simplifies cross-team collaboration, accelerates iterations, and reduces operational costs, such as seamless scaling in hybrid cloud environments.\n\nThe key implementation steps for cloud-native development to promote container orchestration are as follows: first, containerize microservice components; then use Kubernetes to define resource policies for automated deployment and scaling; and combine monitoring tools to optimize performance. In typical scenarios, this ensures the reliable operation of large applications such as big data platforms, delivering business values like efficient resource utilization, rapid fault recovery, and overall cost savings."
