GDPR is the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which requires strict protection of personal data. Cloud-native applications are deployed in cloud environments based on containerization technology, and ensuring compliance can avoid heavy fines and maintain user trust, applicable to scenarios such as e-commerce and financial services that process user data.

The core includes data subject rights (such as the right of access and the right to erasure) and data processing principles (such as purpose limitation and data minimization). In cloud-native architectures, it is necessary to manage data flows by combining microservice isolation and Kubernetes policies (such as RBAC and network policies), and apply encrypted transmission and storage to achieve security. Practical impacts include promoting the application of privacy-by-design frameworks and automated audit tools.

Implementation steps: First, identify and map personal data; second, integrate privacy-by-design (such as encryption by default) into the development process; third, use tools like Kubernetes secrets for data protection; fourth, continuously monitor logs and compliance. Business values include reducing violation risks and enhancing customer loyalty.
