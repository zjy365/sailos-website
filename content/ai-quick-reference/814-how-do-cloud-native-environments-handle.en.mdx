Cloud-native environments need to handle data privacy and compliance, ensuring that sensitive data is protected in distributed architectures and complies with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and legal risks, and it is applied in highly regulated industry scenarios such as finance and healthcare.

Core components include data encryption (at rest and in transit), role-based access control (RBAC), audit logs, and policy enforcement tools such as Kubernetes Secrets and service meshes (e.g., Istio). This enhances end-to-end security and reduces the impact of compliance violations through microservice isolation and automated compliance policies.

Implementation steps: Encrypt data storage and network traffic; configure fine-grained permissions and isolation policies; integrate audit monitoring; adopt compliance frameworks. Business values include reducing the risk of fines, enhancing customer trust, and supporting efficient global deployment.
