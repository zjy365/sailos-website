Cloud-native applications are application architectures designed specifically for cloud environments, emphasizing scalability to handle load fluctuations and resilience to tolerate failures. Their importance lies in achieving business agility and high availability, with application scenarios such as traffic handling during e-commerce peak periods or real-time data analysis systems.

Core components include containerization (e.g., Docker) to achieve environmental consistency, orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes) for automated deployment, and microservices architecture to isolate risks. Features like dynamic resource allocation and automatic recovery mechanisms are based on the principles of load balancing and service discovery. In practical applications, it supports rapid elastic scaling to reduce downtime and leverages cloud platform services to improve multi-tenant efficiency.

Improvement methods involve configuring auto-scaling policies through container orchestration to monitor loads, enabling health checks and redundancy mechanisms to avoid single points of failure. Steps include packaging applications in containers, deploying elastic policies to optimize resources, and implementing DevOps processes. Business value includes improving performance response time by 50%, reducing costs by 20%, and enhancing system resilience to adapt to failure scenarios.
