Cloud-native storage provides persistent, scalable data storage for containerized applications, supporting dynamic volumes and cloud service integration. In e-commerce, protecting storage is crucial for handling sensitive data such as user and payment information, ensuring high availability and compliance, and avoiding business losses caused by data breaches.

Core protection measures include data encryption (at rest and in transit), Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, fine-grained permission control, and network isolation with service meshes. By implementing these features, the attack surface is reduced, data integrity and confidentiality are ensured, which in turn improves application performance and compliance with regulations such as GDPR or PCI DSS.

Implementation steps: 1. Enable built-in encryption for cloud storage services; 2. Configure role-based IAM rules; 3. Deploy log monitoring and backup strategies; 4. Conduct regular security audits. Business values include enhancing customer trust, ensuring transaction continuity, and reducing compliance risks.
