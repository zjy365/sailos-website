  "content": "CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, an automated software delivery process that enhances development efficiency and quality by automatically building, testing, and deploying code. Its importance lies in reducing manual errors, strengthening collaboration, and being applied in DevOps environments to accelerate delivery.\n\nThe core includes automated pipelines, integration testing, and deployment tools, with features such as real-time feedback and environment consistency. In practical applications, development teams iterate on code quickly, while operations teams manage infrastructure, reducing handover delays and enabling seamless collaboration.\n\nImplementation steps: Set up code repository integration with CI tools (e.g., Jenkins), automate testing and building, and deploy to the target environment. A typical scenario is that submitting code triggers the entire process. Business values include shortening release cycles, reducing conflicts, and improving overall team productivity and collaboration efficiency."
