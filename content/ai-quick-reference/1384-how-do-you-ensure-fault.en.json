  "content": "CI/CD pipeline is the core process for automated software integration and delivery, and its fault tolerance can prevent single points of failure from disrupting the development process. This is crucial in cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes management, ensuring high availability and continuous delivery capabilities. Application scenarios include distributed system deployment and rapid iterative releases.\n\nCore components include infrastructure redundancy (such as multi-node clusters to avoid single point of failure), automated testing covering all scenarios, status monitoring and alerts. It features a self-healing mechanism (automatic retry or rollback on failure). It is actually implemented through tools like Jenkins or Argo CD, which can reduce deployment failure rates and improve reliability.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy highly available infrastructure (using cloud service redundancy); 2. Automated test isolation and failure retry; 3. Integrate monitoring tools (Prometheus) for alerts; 4. Set up rollback strategies. A typical scenario is applied in Kubernetes GitOps, with business value of minimizing downtime and accelerating iteration speed."
