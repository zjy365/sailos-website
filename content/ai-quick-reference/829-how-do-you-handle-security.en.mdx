In cloud-native environments, dynamism, scalability, and automation make security patch management crucial, requiring integration into CI/CD processes to ensure the security, compliance, and resilience of applications and infrastructure.

The core components include: leveraging immutable infrastructure (such as container images) to ensure each update is a new deployment; automated processes coordinating upgrades through K8s rolling update strategies; integrating image scanning tools (like Trivy) during the CI phase; adopting policy-as-code (such as OPA); and implementing fine-grained traffic control and canary releases via Service Mesh (like Istio) to mitigate risks. Real-time monitoring of vulnerability announcements (CVEs) drives updates.

Practices need to embed DevSecOps principles throughout: continuously monitoring vulnerability sources and assessing risks; automatically building new images containing fixes; strategically executing rolling updates in K8s (controlling scope and rate); collaborating with service mesh validation and automatically rolling back when necessary. This reduces the attack surface, accelerates security responses, and improves compliance efficiency.
