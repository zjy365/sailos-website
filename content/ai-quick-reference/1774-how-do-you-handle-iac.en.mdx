IaC security vulnerabilities are security weaknesses in Infrastructure as Code deployments that may lead to configuration errors or data breach risks. Their importance lies in ensuring the security compliance and reliability of infrastructure to avoid production disruptions. Application scenarios include cloud automation and DevOps pipelines, such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation deployments.

Core components include static scanning tools (e.g., Checkov or Snyk), Policy as Code, and Policy as a Service. Features include automated detection and continuous integration, identifying configuration issues (such as excessive permissions) through code analysis, directly impacting CI/CD stages, reducing production vulnerabilities, and enhancing compliance.

Processing steps: scan IaC files to identify vulnerabilities; assess risks and fix code; continuously monitor the deployment environment. A typical scenario is Kubernetes configuration file auditing, with business values including preventing security incidents, saving remediation costs, and ensuring business continuity.
