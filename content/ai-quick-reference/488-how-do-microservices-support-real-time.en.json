  "content": "Microservices are an architecture that decomposes applications into independently deployable small services. Real-time data streaming processes continuous data flows, which is crucial in scenarios such as financial transactions and IoT monitoring, supporting instant response, scalability, and fault isolation to enhance business agility.\n\nThrough event-driven mechanisms and API gateways, microservices utilize message queues like Kafka to distribute data streams. Core components include stream processing frameworks (e.g., Spark Streaming) and microservice subscription topics, ensuring low-latency processing, data consistency, and elastic scaling. They are widely used in real-time analysis systems to improve decision-making efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: Set up a message system to distribute streaming data; microservices subscribe to event topics, with processing logic deployed in a containerized environment; integrate stream processors. Business values include reducing response latency, supporting personalized services, and improving system fault tolerance."
