Designing microservices to support multi-tenancy means that a single microservice instance can serve multiple independent customers (tenants) while ensuring the isolation of their data, configurations, and performance. Its importance lies in significantly improving resource utilization, reducing operational costs, and supporting rapid business expansion, mainly applied in scenarios such as SaaS platforms and enterprise-level B2B services.

Core designs include tenant identification mechanisms (such as API tokens or injecting tenant IDs into HTTP headers), data isolation strategies (such as independent database schemas for each tenant, adding tenant ID fields in shared tables), resource quota management (rate limiting, computing isolation), and tenant-level configuration customization. In practice, it is necessary to balance isolation strength (physical/logical) with resource overhead, and integrate unified tenant lifecycle management, monitoring, and billing modules.

Implementation steps include: 1. Defining the tenant model (organization/user group); 2. Designing tenant identity recognition (integration of authentication and authorization); 3. Implementing the data isolation layer (ORM/DB middleware); 4. Deploying quota control (K8s resource limits + API gateway rate limiting); 5. Building a tenant self-service platform. Business value is reflected in scaled cost reduction, elastic scalability, and the core competitiveness of rapid tenant onboarding.
