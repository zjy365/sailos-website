  "content": "Configuration management tools like Ansible manage software settings, while Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform define cloud resources. The importance of their combination lies in achieving consistent and reliable end-to-end automation, reducing human errors, and being applied in cloud deployment and DevOps scenarios to improve scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe core principle is that IaC creates or destroys basic resources (such as virtual machines), while configuration tools handle internal configurations (such as installing dependencies). Through API integration, it ensures synchronization between infrastructure and software environments. In practice, it is applied in continuous integration/delivery pipelines, with impacts including enhancing operational agility, such as quickly recovering from failures, and reducing resource waste.\n\nApplied in automated deployment and elastic scaling, the business values brought include accelerating release cycles, reducing downtime, improving system stability and compliance auditability, and supporting modern IT architectures."
