IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates the management of cloud storage resources (such as object storage) through code, improving deployment efficiency, consistency, and auditability. It is widely used in CI/CD pipelines, supporting the automatic creation and configuration of storage resources, and is suitable for dynamic scaling scenarios.

Core tools include Terraform or CloudFormation, which define resource states in a declarative manner, with features involving version control, idempotent operations, and dependency management. In practical applications, it automatically creates buckets or volume file systems, reducing manual errors; impacts include strengthening security policies, optimizing costs, and enabling environmental reproducibility.

Implementation steps: Write storage definition code (e.g., Terraform configurations) and store it in a version control system; run automated tests for verification; integrate with CI/CD tools to deploy to the cloud platform. Typical scenarios include adjusting storage capacity on demand; business values are rapid change response, cost reduction, and ensuring compliance.
