  "content": "Observability refers to the ability of a system to infer its internal state through external outputs, which is crucial in cloud-native application development as it supports dynamic scaling and rapid fault diagnosis in distributed environments. Application scenarios include monitoring of microservice architectures and performance management of Kubernetes clusters.\n\nIts core components are logs (event records), metrics (performance data), and traces (call chains), characterized by real-time monitoring and in-depth debugging. In practical applications, it significantly helps developers by quickly identifying bottlenecks and preventing faults, thereby improving system reliability and operational efficiency.\n\nIts application value lies in reducing problem response time, optimizing resource utilization, enhancing user experience, ultimately ensuring business continuity and supporting innovative iterations."
