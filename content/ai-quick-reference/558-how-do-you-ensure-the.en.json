  "content": "Ensuring the security of microservices in a multi-cloud environment involves uniformly managing risks of distributed components across multiple cloud platforms. Its importance lies in protecting sensitive data from leakage or disruption during complex network flows, with core scenarios including industries with strict compliance requirements and mission-critical business applications. Security protection can prevent data breaches, service outages, and non-compliance fines.\n\nThe core lies in defense in depth: first, unified Identity and Access Management (IAM) with strict implementation of the principle of least privilege; second, inter-service communication encryption and authorization (such as mTLS, service mesh); third, API gateway implementation of authentication and rate limiting; fourth, automated management of security configurations; fifth, continuous runtime security monitoring. Service mesh capabilities such as Istio provide cross-cloud transparent encryption. Unified integration of platform security capabilities is key.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Develop cross-cloud security policies (zero trust, data sovereignty); 2. Deploy unified IAM and API security gateways; 3. Use service meshes (such as Istio, Linkerd) to automate connection security; 4. Integrate automated security scanning (images, configurations, vulnerabilities) into CI/CD; 5. Deploy Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) to uniformly monitor all cloud environments. The value lies in reducing overall risk, meeting compliance requirements, and protecting the consistency of global assets."
