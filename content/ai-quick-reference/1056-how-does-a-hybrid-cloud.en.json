  "content": "A hybrid cloud strategy integrates public and private cloud resources, allowing sensitive data to remain in a more controllable on-premises environment while the public cloud handles non-sensitive tasks. Its importance lies in complying with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and ensuring that user information is not accessed without authorization. Application scenarios include the financial and healthcare industries, which need to adhere to strict compliance requirements.\n\nCore components include data classification, location control policies, unified security management tools, and encryption technologies. A key feature is flexibility: sensitive data resides in the private cloud to isolate risks, while non-sensitive data leverages the scalability of the public cloud. In practical applications, enterprises can store personally identifiable data in private environments and perform data analysis in the public cloud, thereby reducing leakage risks and improving compliance.\n\nImplementation steps: first classify the sensitivity level of data and designate private cloud deployment for key data; then integrate encryption and access control; finally monitor risks through a unified platform. Typical business values include reducing non-compliance costs, enhancing customer trust, and supporting rapid innovation."
