  "content": "Data-in-transit encryption protects security during data transmission, while data-at-rest encryption ensures the confidentiality of stored data. In cloud-native applications, such as microservice architectures based on Kubernetes, this is crucial for compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and preventing data breaches, and is widely used in data management scenarios in cloud environments.\n\nCore components include transport layer security protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) and key management systems (e.g., KMS). In terms of features, TLS implements client-server communication encryption, and KMS manages encryption keys for storage volumes. In practical applications, transmission security is achieved by configuring certificates through Kubernetes Ingress, and persistent volume encryption ensures data integrity through cloud vendor storage services.\n\nImplementation steps: For data-in-transit encryption, configure load balancers or service meshes (e.g., Istio) to enable TLS; for data-at-rest encryption, use cloud platform encrypted storage options or integrated tools such as HashiCorp Vault to manage keys. This enhances data security, reduces attack risks, and optimizes business compliance."
