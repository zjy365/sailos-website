In cloud-native environments, real-time data synchronization refers to maintaining data consistency among distributed components in near real-time, which is crucial for supporting event-driven microservice architectures and real-time decision-making (such as financial transactions or user analytics), and is applied in scenarios like e-commerce inventory updates and IoT data streams.

The core components include event streaming platforms (e.g., Apache Kafka) and Change Data Capture tools (e.g., Debezium), which achieve low latency and high availability based on the publish/subscribe pattern. In Kubernetes, Operators (e.g., Strimzi) automate the deployment and management of message queues, ensuring elastic scalability and fault tolerance, and promoting microservice decoupling and automated运维.

Processing steps: 1. Deploy CDC to monitor database changes; 2. Publish events to Kafka queues; 3. Create consumer services to process events and update target systems. A typical scenario is online payment synchronization, with business values including reduced latency, improved user experience, and real-time analytics capabilities.
