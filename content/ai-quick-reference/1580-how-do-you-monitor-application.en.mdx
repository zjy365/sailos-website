Monitoring application transactions across cloud-native systems refers to tracking the end-to-end path of user requests in distributed microservices, which is crucial for ensuring system reliability, performance optimization, and rapid fault diagnosis, and is commonly used in high-availability scenarios such as e-commerce or financial services.

The core components of this monitoring include distributed tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger or OpenTelemetry), combined with service meshes (e.g., Istio) to implement context propagation and sampling features, as well as metric collection tools like Prometheus. In practical applications, it aggregates cross-cloud transaction data in real-time, supports bottleneck identification, resource optimization, and security compliance analysis, thereby enhancing overall system resilience.

Implementation steps include: 1. Integrating tracing SDKs into applications; 2. Deploying Collectors to gather data; 3. Configuring visualization tools (e.g., Grafana) to analyze transaction flows. Its business value lies in reducing downtime, enhancing user experience, and ensuring compliance with service level agreements.
