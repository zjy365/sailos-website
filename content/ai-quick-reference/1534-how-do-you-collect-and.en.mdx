Serverless applications run in a cloud-native environment through event-driven mechanisms without the need for infrastructure management. Collecting logs is crucial for monitoring application performance, error detection, and compliance, and is used for troubleshooting and optimization, commonly in scenarios such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.

Core components include log sources (function outputs), cloud platform integration services (e.g., CloudWatch Logs) as collectors, processing tools (e.g., log analysis engines) that support filtering and aggregation, and visualization implemented through dashboards. The log streaming feature ensures real-time performance, with the impact of improving operational efficiency and reducing latency through automatic detection.

Implementation steps: First, configure the application to output standard logs; second, use cloud logging services (such as AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor) to automatically collect and store logs; then use query tools for processing (e.g., setting alert rules); finally, integrate visualization platforms (e.g., Grafana) for monitoring. A typical business scenario is rapid fault recovery, with values including cost reduction and improved reliability.
