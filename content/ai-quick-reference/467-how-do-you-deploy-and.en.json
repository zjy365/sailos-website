  "content": "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used to automate the management of containerized applications; microservices are independent small services in a distributed architecture. Their deployment and management in clusters are crucial as they ensure high availability, elastic scaling, and rapid iteration, with application scenarios including cloud-native systems such as e-commerce platforms and financial services.\n\nThe core components include Deployment objects that define replica sets, Services that implement service discovery and load balancing, and Ingress that controls external access. Features such as declarative configuration and automatic rolling updates simplify maintenance; practical applications require integration with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) to improve operational efficiency and reduce the risk of failures.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Containerize microservice components. 2. Define Deployment and Service resources through YAML files. 3. Deploy using kubectl apply and configure HPA for automatic scaling. A typical scenario is order management microservices in online retail, with business values including accelerating delivery cycles, optimizing resource costs, and enhancing system resilience."
