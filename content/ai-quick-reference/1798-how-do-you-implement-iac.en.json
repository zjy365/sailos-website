  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method for defining, managing, and configuring infrastructure resources through code. It is of core importance in hybrid cloud solutions as it integrates private and public cloud resources, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and automation, and is applied in scenarios such as cloud migration and elastic scaling.\n\nThe core components include IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Azure Resource Manager), declarative configuration modules, and version control systems (e.g., Git). Its features include modular deployment and state tracking. In practical applications, it can uniformly manage multi-cloud resources, improve operational efficiency, reduce error costs, and promote cloud-native innovation.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Select an IaC tool that supports hybrid cloud; 2. Write modular infrastructure templates; 3. Integrate CI/CD pipelines for testing; 4. Automate deployment. A typical scenario is multi-region disaster recovery, with business values including agile resource allocation, cost optimization, and compliance management."
