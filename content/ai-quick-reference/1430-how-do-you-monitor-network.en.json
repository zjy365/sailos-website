  "content": "Monitoring network performance in cloud-native environments is crucial as it ensures reliable communication between microservices, reduces latency, and enhances application availability. Key concepts include measuring metrics such as latency, throughput, and packet loss. Its importance lies in supporting high-concurrency scenarios like e-commerce transactions or IoT data processing to guarantee user experience.\n\nCore components include metric collectors (e.g., Prometheus for collecting network data), visualization tools (e.g., Grafana dashboards), and distributed tracing systems (e.g., Jaeger). Features encompass real-time analysis, container-level monitoring, and end-to-end visibility. Practical applications include service meshes (e.g., Istio for traffic management), with impacts such as optimizing resource allocation and accelerating fault diagnosis.\n\nImplementation steps involve deploying agents (e.g., using eBPF technology), configuring metric collection, setting up alert rules, and analyzing tracing data. Typical scenarios include canary deployments or load testing, with business values of reducing MTTR, improving service SLAs, and enhancing business continuity."
