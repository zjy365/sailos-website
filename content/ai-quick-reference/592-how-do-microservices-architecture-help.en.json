  "content": "Microservices architecture splits an application into independent, deployable service components. This optimizes resource usage by scaling specific services on demand rather than the entire application, avoiding resource waste and suiting high scalability scenarios such as online retail or real-time processing systems.\n\nIts core includes service decoupling and lightweight API communication. Each service can independently adjust resources (e.g., CPU and memory) and utilize containerization technology to dynamically allocate computing units. This improves resource utilization by reducing overall over-provisioning. Integrating Kubernetes for automated management in cloud-native environments significantly lowers operational costs and supports flexible scaling.\n\nDuring implementation, first decompose services into fine-grained units, deploy them independently, set up automatic scaling policies (e.g., using Kubernetes HPA), and combine resource monitoring with cloud billing models. A typical scenario is peak traffic handling. The business value lies in elastic resource management, saving costs and enhancing reliability."
