  "content": "Microservices architecture splits a monolithic application into a set of independently deployable and runnable small services. Its core advantage lies in decoupling the development and deployment lifecycles between services, thereby greatly improving the overall deployment speed and iteration efficiency. This architecture is crucial in modern Continuous Delivery (CD Delivery) scenarios.\n\nThe codebase and deployment unit of each microservice are significantly reduced, allowing independent compilation, testing, and deployment of individual services without the need to coordinate the entire application. This enables higher deployment frequency and smaller scope; a single deployment usually affects only one service, reducing risks and rollback costs. Different teams can develop and deploy their respective services in parallel, greatly shortening the cycle time from development to deployment. New features or fixes can be launched faster.\n\nMicroservices significantly accelerate software delivery. The ability to deploy independently enables teams to implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and respond quickly to changes. This greatly shortens the Time-to-Market for features, enables on-demand release of specific service updates, and ultimately improves business agility and competitiveness."
