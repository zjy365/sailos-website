Serverless applications are based on an event-driven computing model where developers do not need to manage servers, and the platform automatically handles scaling. CI/CD practices improve development efficiency through automated building, testing, and deployment, suitable for applications requiring rapid iteration, such as API backends or data processing services.

Core components include code repositories, CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins), and deployment frameworks (e.g., Serverless Framework). The automated pipeline triggers building, runs unit and integration tests, packages the application upon code submission, and deploys it to serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, ensuring reliability and reducing human errors.

Implementation steps: 1. Set up the code repository and CI/CD tool configuration. 2. Define the workflow: build the application and execute tests. 3. Deploy to the target environment using plugins such as the serverless-deploy command. Typical scenarios include microservice updates, with business values including shortened release cycles, enhanced scalability, and reduced costs.
