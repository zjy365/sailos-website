Implementing automated deployment of machine learning models in a CI/CD pipeline involves using continuous integration and continuous delivery tools to automatically complete the process from model training to production deployment. This concept is crucial for rapid iteration and consistency, and can be applied to online prediction services such as recommendation systems to shorten model update cycles and reduce manual errors.

Core components include version control (e.g., Git), integration with CI tools (e.g., Jenkins or GitHub Actions) to execute code testing and model building, encapsulating models through containerization (Docker), and deploying to Kubernetes clusters for orchestration. Features include automation, reproducibility, and built-in monitoring. In practical applications, it simplifies model version management, improves MLOps efficiency, accelerates business response, supports scenarios such as A/B testing, and promotes agile development.

Implementation steps include: storing model code in a Git repository; configuring CI pipelines to trigger testing and container building; pushing images to a registry; deploying to Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling. A typical scenario is deploying AI inference services to cloud platforms. Business value includes shortening deployment time, improving reliability, reducing operational costs through automation, and promoting rapid model iteration and innovation.
