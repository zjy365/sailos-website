  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure deployment through code, ensuring consistency and repeatability. Its importance lies in supporting compliance, security, and efficiency, applied in cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes clusters to reduce manual errors and accelerate deployment.\n\nCore components include Policy as Code, version control (e.g., Git), and automated testing tools (e.g., OPA or Checkov). Features emphasize auditability and standardization. In practical applications, continuous validation is achieved by integrating into CI/CD pipelines, with impacts including preventing configuration drift and enhancing security.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define standard policies as code files. 2. Integrate static analysis tools for scanning in CI/CD. 3. Enforce code reviews and automated testing. 4. Monitor deployment compliance and provide feedback for optimization. A typical scenario is automatically checking security baselines when configuring Kubernetes resources. The business value is reducing risks, accelerating iterations, and ensuring efficient resource utilization."
