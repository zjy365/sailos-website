  "content": "Expanding and optimizing the container performance of cloud-native applications is a core practice to enhance application responsiveness and resource efficiency, which is crucial in high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce and finance. It ensures the elastic scaling of applications to meet business peak demands while reducing cloud resource costs.\n\nThe core includes horizontal scaling (e.g., Kubernetes HPA automatically increasing or decreasing Pod replicas based on CPU/memory metrics), vertical scaling (VPA adjusting container resource limits), resource request and limit configuration (to avoid overload or waste), and container runtime optimization (e.g., using lightweight base images). These are implemented through platforms like Kubernetes, combined with monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) for real-time performance analysis, significantly improving throughput and reducing latency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define resource requests and limits; 2. Configure HPA and set scaling thresholds; 3. Optimize container images (simplify layers, multi-stage builds); 4. Integrate service mesh (e.g., Istio) for traffic management; 5. Continuously monitor and tune. The value lies in improving user experience, ensuring SLA, and reducing cloud costs by 30%+."
