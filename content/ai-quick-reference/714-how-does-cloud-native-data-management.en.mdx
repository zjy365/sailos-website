Cloud-native data management leverages containerization and Kubernetes technologies to automate data storage, processing, and flow in cloud environments, enhancing the scalability and elasticity of data processing. It plays a crucial role in data visualization, supporting scenarios such as real-time data analysis and business dashboards, ensuring stable and reliable data sources, and accelerating decision-making efficiency.

Its core components include containerized databases (e.g., MySQL on Kubernetes), data pipeline tools (e.g., Apache Kafka), and an automated orchestration layer, enabling seamless data integration and cleansing. This accelerates the data preparation process, allowing visualization tools (e.g., Grafana) to directly access consistent datasets, improving response speeds, reducing maintenance costs, and addressing the challenges of large-scale dynamic data.

Practical implementation steps: Deploy cloud-native storage (e.g., Rook or Amazon EKS), integrate ETL services to build data pipelines, and link with BI tools (e.g., Power BI). A typical scenario is a real-time inventory dashboard that enhances business value, reduces latency, optimizes resource utilization, and supports enterprises in gaining rapid insights to drive revenue growth.
