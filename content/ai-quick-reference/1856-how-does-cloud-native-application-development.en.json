  "content": "Cloud-native application development leverages the elasticity, automation, and service-oriented features of cloud platforms, such as container and microservice architectures, to significantly enhance software iteration speed and deployment efficiency. Its importance lies in supporting agile development, reducing manual intervention, and being widely applied in internet services and rapidly changing market environments.\n\nCore components include microservices for loose coupling, container technology to ensure environmental consistency, and Kubernetes for automatic scaling and fault recovery. CI/CD pipelines automate building, testing, and deployment, shortening release cycles. Practical impacts include high-frequency updates, high availability, and promotion of business innovation and competitiveness.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Design the architecture as microservices; 2) Containerize the application; 3) Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster; 4) Integrate CI/CD tools to automate the pipeline. Typical scenarios include e-commerce platform updates, with business values covering accelerated time-to-market, improved system stability, and reduced operational costs."
