  "content": "Microservice communication is key to inter-service interaction in cloud-native applications, ensuring reliable message delivery in distributed systems. In cloud-native development such as containerized environments, it supports modularity, elasticity, and agile deployment, suitable for e-commerce platform backend integration or microservice-oriented applications.\n\nCore components include service discovery (e.g., etcd), API gateways (e.g., Envoy), message queues (e.g., Kafka), and service meshes (e.g., Istio), providing load balancing, fault isolation, and security policies. Cloud-native tools like Kubernetes integrate these mechanisms to optimize traffic management, enhance system reliability, and reduce deployment complexity.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy a service registry for dynamic service discovery; configure an API gateway to handle ingress routing and authentication; integrate a service mesh to monitor communication links; utilize message queues for asynchronous interaction. Business values include improved fault tolerance, reduced costs, and support for large-scale microservice scaling."
