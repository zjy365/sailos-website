CI/CD pipeline is an automated software development practice that rapidly integrates code changes and securely releases them through continuous integration and continuous deployment. It is crucial in cloud-native applications, accelerating delivery, reducing errors, and suitable for frequently updated microservice environments.

Core components include version control systems (e.g., Git), build tools (e.g., Jenkins), testing frameworks, and deployment engines (e.g., Kubernetes). The principle is that code commits trigger an automated process: building code packages, executing tests, and deploying to environments, ensuring consistency and reliability. In practice, it improves development efficiency, supports agile teams in rapid iteration, and brings high availability and cost optimization to businesses.

Implementation steps include: integrating code repositories to configure webhooks; automating build steps such as compilation and packaging; adding unit and integration tests; setting up deployment pipelines to testing and production environments; monitoring logs and integrating alert mechanisms. A typical scenario is containerized application updates, enabling minute-level releases and enhancing market responsiveness.
