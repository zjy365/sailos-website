  "content": "Multi-cloud deployment refers to enterprises using multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS and Azure) simultaneously to enhance resilience and avoid vendor lock-in, commonly used in scenarios with high availability requirements. Single-cloud deployment relies solely on a single provider, simplifying management and reducing costs, suitable for startups or stable applications. Distinguishing between the two is crucial for business continuity.\n\nThe core of multi-cloud deployment includes interoperability and redundancy mechanisms, emphasizing consistent cross-cloud management, which actually brings disaster recovery advantages but increases complexity. Single-cloud deployment focuses on unified monitoring and optimization, supporting rapid iteration but with higher risks when the provider fails. This difference significantly affects resource strategies and promotes the integration of cloud-native technologies.\n\nMulti-cloud deployment is applied to critical systems to eliminate single points of failure, with its value lying in flexible scalability and cost bargaining power. The value of single-cloud deployment is concentrated on simplifying operation and maintenance and enabling rapid market entry, suitable for business scenarios with predictable requirements."
