In microservices, session management refers to sharing user states (such as authentication information) across distributed services to provide a consistent experience. Its importance lies in improving system scalability and reliability, and avoiding single points of failure caused by state coupling. Application scenarios include e-commerce platform login and user personalized services.

The core adopts a stateless design: each microservice operates independently and does not store state. Features include using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to carry user claims, API gateway centralized verification, and external storage (such as Redis) for data management. In practical applications, the API gateway intercepts requests and verifies tokens to reduce service load; the impact is enhanced elasticity but requires security protection (such as preventing token leakage).

Implementation steps: 1. Implement single sign-on using JWT; 2. Deploy API gateway routing and verify requests; 3. Integrate external cache (such as Redis) to store sessions; 4. Monitor token expiration. Business values include improving user experience (seamless interaction), operational flexibility (elastic scaling), and cost efficiency.
