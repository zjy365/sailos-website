Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a network architecture that centrally controls network devices through software to enable flexible management. A hybrid cloud environment integrates private and public cloud resources to optimize resource allocation. In hybrid clouds, the core role of SDN is to unify network orchestration, enhance agility and consistency, and is suitable for scenarios such as enterprise cloud migration, disaster recovery, and data security, ensuring seamless cross-cloud operations.

The core of SDN includes controllers, APIs, and virtual network functions, characterized by automation and programmability, based on the principle of separating the control layer and the data layer. In hybrid clouds, it supports dynamic routing, cross-cloud VPN establishment, and security policy synchronization, such as automatic traffic load balancing and intrusion prevention. This application significantly improves network interoperability, reduces latency and operational costs, and enhances compliance.

SDN enables hybrid cloud network programmability, simplifying configuration deployment and policy management. Its value includes accelerating resource provisioning, supporting business flexibility (such as multi-tenant isolation), reducing security risks, and optimizing overall cloud strategy efficiency.
