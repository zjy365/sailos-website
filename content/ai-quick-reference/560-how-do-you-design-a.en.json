  "content": "Microservices architecture splits a monolithic application into independently deployable small services, each responsible for specific business capabilities and collaborating through lightweight communication. This design enhances system scalability, fault tolerance, and agility, making it suitable for large and complex applications such as e-commerce platforms or enterprise SaaS systems, supporting high concurrency and rapid iteration requirements.\n\nCore characteristics include service autonomy (independent development and deployment), the single responsibility principle, and loosely coupled communication (typically via REST or gRPC). In practice, it is necessary to integrate API gateways (unified entry points), service discovery (e.g., Consul), and containerization (e.g., Kubernetes). Its impacts include support for technological heterogeneity (different languages/databases), DevOps automation (CI/CD pipelines), and resource optimization (elastic scaling), promoting team collaboration and innovation.\n\nImplementation steps are as follows: First,划分 business boundaries based on domain-driven design; second, define service interfaces and communication protocols; then, build infrastructure (container orchestration, service mesh); next, implement automated deployment and testing; finally, integrate monitoring (e.g., Prometheus) and logging systems to ensure operational visibility and rapid fault recovery."
