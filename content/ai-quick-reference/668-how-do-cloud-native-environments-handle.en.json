  "content": "A cloud-native environment refers to a cloud application platform based on container and microservice architectures, such as Kubernetes, used for dynamically scalable and highly available services. Database schema changes involve modifying data structures (such as table definitions), and their importance lies in supporting seamless updates during agile development to avoid downtime; they are common in microservice scenarios, such as database adjustments when adding new features or optimizing performance.\n\nThis process relies on automation tools (such as Flyway or Liquibase) to manage versioned change scripts, with core features including atomic operations and rollback mechanisms to ensure changes are synchronized with CI/CD pipelines. In principle, change scripts are executed sequentially during application deployment, and consistency is ensured through Kubernetes health checks. In practical applications, it reduces deployment risks, improves reliability, and has a positive impact on the cloud-native ecosystem such as microservice isolation and continuous delivery.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1) Writing version-controlled SQL change scripts; 2) Integrating into CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins); 3) Automatically applying changes during Kubernetes rolling updates. A typical scenario is zero-downtime upgrades for new features, with business values including efficient iteration, minimized downtime losses, and improved team productivity."
