  "content": "Tracking and optimizing performance metrics of cloud-native applications involves monitoring resource usage, response latency, and service availability to ensure continuous and efficient operation. Its importance lies in maintaining application stability, optimizing costs, and enhancing user experience, especially when handling high-concurrency scenarios in microservice architectures, such as e-commerce platforms or real-time services.\n\nThe core components include deploying toolchains like Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for data visualization, and combining service meshes like Istio for full-link tracing. The principle is based on real-time monitoring and analysis, with automated responses to bottlenecks through alert rules. Practical applications include identifying CPU/memory peaks, optimizing Kubernetes resource configurations (such as HPA auto-scaling), and significantly improving throughput and fault tolerance.\n\nImplementation steps: Integrate monitoring tools (Prometheus, Loki); Define metrics (such as request latency, error rate); Configure alerts; Analyze data to optimize code or resources. Typical scenarios respond to traffic surges. Business value includes reducing latency by 50%, cutting costs by 30%, and enhancing availability."
