In cloud-native development environments, cost optimization refers to efficiently managing resource expenses to reduce cloud service fees. Its importance lies in improving resource utilization, avoiding waste, and lowering operational costs, applicable to enterprise-level cloud deployments such as microservice applications in Kubernetes clusters.

The core components include dynamic resource scheduling, auto-scaling policies, and cost monitoring tools. The principle is to minimize expenditures by optimizing container resource requests and reducing excess supply. In practical applications, tools like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and cloud-native cost management platforms (e.g., Kubecost) enable fine-grained control, significantly reducing monthly bills and improving return on investment.

Optimization steps include setting container resource requests and limits, implementing HPA policies to elastically adjust the number of replicas, and utilizing cloud provider reserved instances or Spot instance discounts. A typical scenario is optimizing microservice resource configurations, with business value of reducing cloud costs by 30%-50% and improving operational efficiency.
