In a distributed microservices architecture, secure communication ensures the integrity and confidentiality of data transmission between services. This concept is crucial because microservices are typically deployed across multiple environments (such as Kubernetes clusters) and face risks of eavesdropping and injection attacks; its application scenarios include sensitive business processing like e-commerce and financial systems, which can prevent data leakage and maintain service availability.

Core components include Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, service meshes (e.g., Istio or Linkerd), mutual authentication (mTLS), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). These features provide end-to-end protection, enabling service authentication and dynamic authorization. In practical applications, they simplify secure interactions between microservices, reduce the attack surface, and significantly enhance the compliance of cloud-native systems, promoting the automation of DevSecOps processes.

Implementation steps: First, deploy the service mesh infrastructure and configure mTLS to enable mutual authentication; second, integrate identity providers (e.g., OAuth or SPIFFE) to manage certificates; finally, set up monitoring and alert systems. Typical scenarios include microservice API calls or message queue communication. The business value lies in reducing the risk of network attacks, enhancing user trust, and supporting compliance with regulations such as GDPR.
