Cloud-native application security monitors and protects containerized application environments through automated tools, with key concepts including vulnerability scanning and compliance management. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and service disruptions, with application scenarios involving Kubernetes clusters and CI/CD workflows.

Core components include Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Scanning (DAST), and runtime protection tools. Features encompass real-time monitoring, automatic remediation, and policy enforcement. In practical applications, it is integrated into DevOps processes to improve response speed and reduce human errors, thereby enhancing security resilience for the cloud-native ecosystem.

Implementation steps: first evaluate tools (such as Trivy or Falco), then integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated scanning and alerting; continuously monitor logs and deploy remediation scripts. A typical scenario is code review in agile development; business values include reducing vulnerability risks, ensuring compliance, and optimizing operational costs.
