Security compliance in the CI/CD process refers to the integration of security policies and regulatory compliance measures into the automated software building, testing, and deployment workflows. The importance of this concept lies in preventing security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and compliance violations (such as GDPR or ISO 27001), and it is particularly applicable to cloud-native deployments and high-frequency update environments, such as the financial or healthcare industries.

Core components include Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), dependency scanning, and secret management, characterized by automated gating, continuous monitoring, and audit trails. The principle emphasizes shifting security left, i.e., detecting risks early in the development process. In practical applications, Kubernetes admission controllers or GitHub Actions are used to enforce policies, ensure configuration compliance, improve DevOps efficiency, and reduce the impact of security incidents.

Implementation steps are: 1. Integrate SAST and dependency scanning tools into the CI pipeline; 2. Add DAST and compliance gates in the deployment phase; 3. Validate security configurations through Infrastructure as Code; 4. Conduct regular audits and generate reports. Typical scenarios include automatically rejecting builds with vulnerabilities, and business values include risk reduction, accelerated compliance certification, and support for business continuity.
