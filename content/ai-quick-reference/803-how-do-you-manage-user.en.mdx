User authentication refers to the process of verifying a user's identity. In cloud-native applications, such as microservice environments based on Kubernetes, managing authentication is crucial to ensure security, prevent unauthorized access, and support distributed scenarios like multi-tenant SaaS platforms.

The core includes OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect protocols, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT), using components such as API gateways (e.g., Kong or Istio Ingress) for proxy authentication, and service meshes (e.g., Linkerd) for handling mTLS and authorization policies. In practical applications, integrating identity providers (IdPs) such as Keycloak or cloud services (e.g., AWS Cognito) enables centralized management, reduces service coupling, and enhances overall zero-trust security.

Implementation steps: Select a protocol (e.g., OpenID Connect); deploy a central IdP and configure services; route and verify JWT through an API gateway; apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to authorize user operations. A typical scenario is microservice applications where each service delegates authentication to simplify logic. The business value lies in enhanced security, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and development efficiency.
