Data migration for cloud-native applications refers to the process of securely transferring application state data in dynamic environments such as Kubernetes. Its importance lies in supporting elastic scaling, cross-cloud/hybrid cloud deployments, and continuous delivery scenarios (e.g., blue-green deployments, version upgrades) to ensure business continuity. Common application scenarios include cluster migration, storage backend replacement, or cross-region disaster recovery.

The core principle is to decouple applications from storage: abstract storage resources through Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), and standardize storage plugins using the Container Storage Interface (CSI). Migration requires attention to data consistency (transactional vs. eventual consistency), migration methods (offline snapshot cloning vs. online synchronization), and toolchain selection (e.g., Velero/Restic, storage vendor tools). Key challenges include network bandwidth optimization, migration window constraints, and verification of storage compatibility in the target environment.

Practical operations typically include: 1) Assessing the migration scope and SLA (allowed downtime); 2) Creating PV snapshots or application-consistent backups using tools (e.g., Velero); 3) Reconstructing application deployment configurations in the target cluster; 4) Restoring and mounting data volumes; 5) Verifying traffic switching. Its core value is to enhance application portability, reduce vendor lock-in risks, and minimize manual intervention and operational costs through automated processes.
