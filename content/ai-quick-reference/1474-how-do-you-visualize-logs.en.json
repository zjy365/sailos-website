  "content": "Log and metric data record system events and performance metrics respectively. Visualization transforms them into graphs for easier understanding and analysis, enhancing system observability. Its importance lies in quickly identifying anomalies, optimizing performance, and accelerating fault response, with wide applications in IT operations, cloud-native monitoring, and business analysis.\n\nCore components include data collectors (such as Fluentd or Prometheus), repositories (such as Elasticsearch), and visualization tools (such as Grafana or Kibana). Features involve real-time dashboards, custom views, and alert mechanisms. The principle is to aggregate and display raw data through a query engine. In practical applications, it supports monitoring container health, tracking application latency, significantly reducing mean time to repair, and enhancing scalability.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1. Integrating data sources to collect logs and metrics. 2. Configuring visualization tools to create dashboards. 3. Setting up alert rules for analysis. Typical scenarios include monitoring Kubernetes cluster status or application performance. Business value lies in improving operational efficiency, reducing downtime losses, and supporting data-driven decision-making."
