  "content": "CI/CD pipeline is a toolchain that automates the building, testing, and deployment of code changes. Security updates include vulnerability patches and software fixes, whose importance lies in preventing cyberattacks and ensuring system integrity. They are commonly used in containerized environments such as Kubernetes clusters to accelerate the repair cycle and maintain compliance.\n\nThe core components include security scanning tools (e.g., Trivy or Clair), which are integrated into the pipeline to perform vulnerability detection; features include automated testing, policy validation, and audit logs. Practical applications involve scanning images during the build phase, and triggering fixes or notifications if vulnerabilities are found. This improves the overall security posture, reduces the exposure window, and enhances the trustworthiness of cloud-native environments.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Add a security scanning phase in the pipeline and use tools to detect updates; 2. Configure an automatic deployment mechanism to ensure direct deployment after passing tests; 3. Incorporate a rollback strategy to handle failure scenarios. Typical values are reducing security risks, accelerating responses, saving operation and maintenance costs, and meeting regulatory requirements."
