  "content": "In cloud-native environments, network performance monitoring is crucial for ensuring high reliability and low latency of distributed applications, applicable to communication and traffic management scenarios under microservice architectures.\n\nThe core components include using tools like Prometheus to collect metrics, eBPF for network tracing, and combining with distributed tracing systems to achieve end-to-end visibility; in practical applications, it can diagnose bottlenecks, optimize topology, enhance observability, and reduce fault risks.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy a service mesh (such as Istio), enable network monitoring, set up monitoring agents (such as CNI plugins) in the Kubernetes cluster, and configure metric alerts; typical scenarios monitor inter-service latency to bring business value such as reducing downtime and improving user experience."
