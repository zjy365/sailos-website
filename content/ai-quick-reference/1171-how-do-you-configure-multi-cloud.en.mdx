Multi-cloud Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure network technology used to establish private connections between multiple cloud services (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). Its importance lies in ensuring encrypted and isolated data transmission, enhancing business continuity, security, and cross-cloud resource management. Application scenarios include enterprises building hybrid cloud architectures, implementing disaster recovery or global distributed systems, and supporting inter-cloud resource sharing.

Core components include VPN gateways, encryption protocols (such as IPsec), tunneling mechanisms, and routing policies. Features are end-to-end security, high availability, and scalability. In practical applications, it simplifies multi-cloud network integration, reduces latency, enhances compliance, improves IT agility and cost-effectiveness, especially enabling seamless resource communication in hybrid cloud deployments.

Implementation steps: 1. Assess network requirements and identify compatible cloud platform VPN services; 2. Configure VPN gateways in each cloud, set encryption keys and tunnel parameters; 3. Define routing rules to connect subnets; 4. Test connections and monitor performance. A typical scenario is AWS VPC interconnection with Azure VNet. Business values include reducing security risks, optimizing multi-vendor costs, and accelerating digital transformation.
