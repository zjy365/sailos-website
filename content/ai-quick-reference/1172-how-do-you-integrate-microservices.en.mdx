Microservices involve decomposing an application into independent, deployable components, while hybrid cloud deployment combines public and private cloud resources. Integration is crucial as it enables seamless service deployment across cloud environments, optimizes resource usage, enhances elastic scaling, and improves high availability. It is suitable for enterprise scenarios requiring flexibility (such as handling traffic spikes) and security compliance, like e-commerce or financial services.

Core components include API gateways that provide a unified entry point, service discovery tools like Consul for locating service instances, and load balancers for traffic distribution. Its characteristics rely on container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, which achieve cross-cloud consistency by abstracting infrastructure. In principle, multi-cloud management tools are used to ensure deployment uniformity. Practical applications include deploying to AWS public cloud and on-premises private cloud, driving DevOps automation, reducing vendor lock-in, and enhancing fault tolerance.

Implementation steps: Containerize microservices using Docker to build images; deploy Kubernetes clusters and configure cross-cloud support (e.g., cluster federation); integrate service meshes like Istio to manage traffic and security policies; and set up monitoring and continuous deployment tools. Typical business values include agile adaptation to market changes, reduced downtime risks for disaster recovery, and cost optimization through on-demand resource scaling.
