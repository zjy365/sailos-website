  "content": "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed specifically for managing cloud-native applications (based on containers and microservices). Its importance lies in automating the deployment, scaling, and maintenance of services, enhancing system resilience and efficiency. Application scenarios include microservice architectures, continuous integration/deployment pipelines, etc.\n\nCore components include Pods (container units), Services (network access), and Deployments (replica management). Features涵盖 self-healing, load balancing, and horizontal auto-scaling (such as HPA). In practical applications, enterprises deploy services through declarative configurations to achieve fault recovery and dynamic scaling. In terms of impact, it simplifies operation and maintenance, promotes the development of cloud-native ecosystems, and improves portability.\n\nWhen handling service orchestration: containerize applications and push them to the repository. Use YAML files to define Deployments and Services for deploying services. Configure auto-scaling policies and Ingress routing. Typical steps include: image building → application manifest → monitoring logs. Business values such as automatically handling traffic peaks and reducing costs, for example, the high availability guarantee of e-commerce platforms."
