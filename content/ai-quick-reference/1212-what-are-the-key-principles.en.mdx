CI/CD strategy is the core of the continuous integration/continuous deployment approach, ensuring frequent and reliable code delivery by automating software build, testing, and deployment processes. Its importance lies in enhancing the speed, quality, and reliability of software releases, and it is suitable for cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes management to support agile development and rapid iteration.

Key principles include high automation (covering compilation, testing, and deployment), frequent small-batch commits to minimize risks, rapid feedback mechanisms (such as instant test reports), reproducible build pipelines, and robust rollback mechanisms. These principles are based on version control and continuous monitoring. In practical applications, they reduce human errors, shorten release cycles, and enhance the collaboration efficiency of DevOps teams and overall delivery resilience.

The application value of this strategy is reflected in achieving seamless and efficient production deployment, promoting business agility; the values include accelerating time-to-market, improving code reliability, optimizing resource utilization, and significantly reducing maintenance costs and risks.
