In cloud-native environments, observability data provides real-time system insights through logs, metrics, and traces, serving as the core of security monitoring. It identifies threats such as configuration errors or attack patterns, applicable to continuous auditing and threat prevention scenarios.

The core components include log analysis (detecting malicious activities), metric monitoring (alerting on abnormal behaviors), and distributed tracing (analyzing vulnerabilities in data paths). In application, these tools are integrated into security operations to automate responses to intrusion events, significantly reducing the exposure risks of cloud-native applications.

During implementation, data is first collected (using agents like Fluentd), then security tools (such as SIEM or Prometheus) are used to analyze correlated events and set alert rules. A typical scenario is the rapid identification of unauthorized access, bringing business values such as accelerated response, reduced non-compliance losses, and maintained compliance.
