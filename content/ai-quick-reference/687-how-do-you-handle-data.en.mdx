In cloud-native environments, multi-tenant application data partitioning achieves isolation, privacy, and scalability by separating tenant data, which is core to SaaS and enterprise service scenarios and improves resource efficiency.

Partitioning strategies include tenant ID identification, logical sharding (such as database table partitioning), or physical isolation (dedicated storage). Combined with Kubernetes namespaces, Istio, and other service meshes, network and storage isolation are ensured, improving utilization and reducing costs.

Implementation steps: 1. Design a tenant identification mechanism; 2. Select a partitioning method (such as ID-based routing); 3. Configure storage layer sharding; 4. Monitor resource quotas. Business values include rapid tenant deployment, compliance, and operational optimization.
