Automated deployment executes the software release process through automated tools, significantly shortening deployment time and reducing human errors. This is crucial for infrastructure scaling, especially in cloud computing and microservices architectures, supporting elastic responses to traffic surges and ensuring high service availability and continuous delivery. Typical application scenarios include handling peak loads from e-commerce promotions or emergency scaling requirements.

Its core components include configuration management tools (such as Ansible or Terraform), CI/CD pipelines (such as Jenkins), and auto-scaling mechanisms. The principle is based on Infrastructure as Code (IaC), achieving environmental consistency and reproducibility; features like rapid response capability enable the infrastructure to automatically scale horizontally (increasing the number of instances) or vertically (enhancing resource capacity), thereby optimizing resource utilization and improving system stability.

Implementation steps include defining IaC scripts to automatically create resources; configuring Horizontal Pod Autoscaler in Kubernetes to trigger scaling. Typical scenarios include load balancing for cloud-native applications, delivering business value such as shortening time-to-market by over 30%, reducing operational costs, and enhancing scalability to support business growth.
