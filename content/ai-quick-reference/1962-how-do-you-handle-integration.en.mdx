Integration testing of cloud-native applications ensures system reliability and scalability by verifying interactions and data flows between microservices in cloud environments. Its importance lies in supporting rapid iterations for continuous deployment, applicable to Kubernetes clusters and multi-tenant container platforms.

The core includes creating isolated testing environments using automation frameworks such as Testcontainers and Kubernetes Operators, combined with infrastructure as code to achieve consistency. Features involve mock services (e.g., WireMock) and end-to-end traffic testing. Application scenarios cover API contract validation, data consistency checks, and automated testing in CI/CD pipelines to prevent distributed system failures.

Processing steps: 1. Define YAML files for the testing environment. 2. Integrate and run test scripts in CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins). 3. Clean up resources after analyzing logs and metrics. Typical business values are improving deployment speed, reducing production error rates, and supporting observability optimization.
