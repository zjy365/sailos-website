  "content": "Cloud-native environments utilize containerization, microservices, and automated infrastructure to achieve high elasticity and portability of applications, facilitating the efficient operation of continuous delivery pipelines. Their importance lies in supporting rapid iteration, automatic deployment, and reliable rollbacks, which are applied in DevOps practices to enhance software development agility and business responsiveness.\n\nCore features include containers ensuring environmental consistency, and Kubernetes providing automated orchestration and service discovery. These principles reduce deployment failures and shorten release cycles through zero-downtime updates and elastic scaling. In practical applications, they drive automated testing and monitoring, significantly improving system reliability and development efficiency.\n\nDuring implementation, containerize applications and integrate CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins and K8s) to automate the build, test, and deployment stages. Typical scenarios include frequent feature updates, bringing business values such as accelerating market delivery, reducing costs, and optimizing resource utilization."
