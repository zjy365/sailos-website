  "content": "Cloud-native performance monitoring refers to the use of tools to track application performance in cloud environments, ensuring high availability, efficiency, and rapid fault response. Its importance lies in optimizing resource utilization and maintaining Service Level Agreements (SLAs). It is mainly applied in Kubernetes clusters, microservice architectures, and DevOps processes to enhance user experience and business continuity.\n\nThe core components include metric collection (such as CPU and memory), distributed tracing, log management, and visualization dashboards. These features provide real-time performance, scalability, and integration capabilities; practical applications support bottleneck identification, capacity planning, and service mesh monitoring, driving automatic repair, cost optimization, and faster iterative delivery, thereby reducing downtime in the cloud-native ecosystem.\n\nCommonly used tools include Prometheus (open-source metrics monitoring), Grafana (data visualization), Jaeger (tracing), and Datadog (full-stack monitoring). These tools provide end-to-end visibility, rapid diagnosis, and alert mechanisms, with the value of improving operational efficiency, reducing risks, and supporting data-driven decision-making."
