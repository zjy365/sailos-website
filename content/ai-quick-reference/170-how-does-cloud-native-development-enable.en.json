  "content": "Cloud-native development achieves resource optimization through containerization, microservices, and dynamic orchestration. Its core lies in the on-demand allocation of computing, storage, and network resources, eliminating the redundant overhead of traditional virtual machines. This optimization is crucial in scenarios with dynamic business loads (such as e-commerce promotions and sudden traffic spikes in online services), significantly reducing infrastructure costs while enhancing system elasticity and resource utilization.\n\nOptimization relies on core technologies: containers (lightweight isolation), Kubernetes orchestration (automated deployment/scheduling), horizontal scaling (HPA/VPA), and granular monitoring. Key features include declarative resource quotas (requests/limits) to restrict application resource consumption, combined with Cluster Autoscaler to dynamically adjust the number of nodes. In practice, microservices automatically scale replica counts based on load, idle resources are reclaimed, mixed deployment of multiple applications improves node utilization, and monitoring metrics via Prometheus and Grafana drive optimization decisions to achieve precise matching between resources and business needs.\n\nSpecific implementation steps:\n\n1. Containerize applications: Package into Docker images and define clear resource requirements.\n\n2. Kubernetes configuration: Set requests (minimum resource guarantees) and limits (maximum resource caps).\n\n3. Autoscaling: Configure HPA (scale Pods based on CPU/memory metrics) and VPA (vertically adjust single Pod resources).\n\n4. Monitoring and analysis: Integrate tools (e.g., Prometheus/Lens) to track resource utilization in real-time and identify inefficient applications.\n\n5. Cost optimization: Use FinOps to analyze bills, decommission idle resources, and select spot instances.\n\nTypical scenarios include automatically scaling stateless services during traffic peaks or reducing resources in development environments at night. Business value is reflected in 30%-50% lower cloud costs while ensuring SLA stability."
