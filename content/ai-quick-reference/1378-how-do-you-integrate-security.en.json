  "content": "Integrating security policies into CI/CD workflows refers to automating security testing in continuous integration and deployment pipelines to ensure the security and compliance of code and deployments. Its importance includes early vulnerability detection to reduce production risks; it is suitable for cloud-native application development in DevOps environments to enable rapid iteration.\n\nCore components include Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Software Composition Analysis (SCA). Its features are automated scanning running in the build and testing phases, and the principle is to shift security left to the early stages of development. Practical applications include embedding scans in tools such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions, with impacts including promoting a DevSecOps culture, reducing vulnerability exposure, and enhancing regulatory compliance.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define policies and select tools such as SonarQube or OWASP ZAP; 2. Integrate into the CI/CD pipeline and configure trigger conditions; 3. Automate testing and review reports. A typical scenario is pre-deployment scanning. Business values include improving release security, shortening vulnerability remediation cycles, and reducing compliance costs."
