Scaling individual microservices in the cloud environment refers to the process of dynamically adjusting the number of service instances based on real-time loads to meet performance and availability requirements. Its importance lies in coping with traffic fluctuations, optimizing resource utilization, and ensuring business continuity, which is a key capability for building resilient cloud-native applications, commonly used in scenarios such as e-commerce promotions and service degradation recovery.

The core mechanism of scaling is based on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), involving three core components: resource monitoring (e.g., CPU, memory, custom QPS metrics), predefined scaling policies (threshold triggering or scheduled plans), and container orchestration platform coordination (e.g., Kubernetes). The platform automatically increases or decreases the number of Pod replicas by comparing monitoring metrics with policy thresholds. This process relies on the stateless design of services and needs to be integrated with cloud load balancers to distribute traffic.

Implementation steps include: 1) Deploying monitoring agents to expose key service metrics; 2) Defining scaling policies (e.g., scaling out when CPU utilization > 70%); 3) Creating HPA objects in K8s associated with Deployment; 4) Configuring resource limits and requests; 5) Verifying scaling effects and rollback mechanisms. The business value lies in automatically scaling out during peak hours to ensure SLA, and scaling in during off-peak hours to reduce computing costs by 30%-50%, achieving refined resource management.
