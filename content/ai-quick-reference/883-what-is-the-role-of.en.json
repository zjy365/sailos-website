  "content": "Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are centralized security platforms used to collect, analyze, and respond to security data. In cloud-native environments such as containerized applications and Kubernetes clusters, SIEM is crucial as it provides real-time visibility into distributed systems, identifies threats, and ensures compliance, commonly used for monitoring in multi-cloud scenarios and microservices architectures.\n\nThe core components of SIEM include log aggregation engines, event correlation algorithms, and alert mechanisms, characterized by real-time analysis and AI-driven detection. In principle, by integrating container logs, service mesh traffic, and API call data, SIEM enables threat hunting and automated response in cloud-native environments; its practical applications involve monitoring services like Istio, with the impact of enhancing overall security posture, supporting DevSecOps processes, and reducing the spread risk of security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn terms of applications, SIEM is used to detect intrusions, investigate incidents, and generate compliance reports; its value is reflected in reducing Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), lowering business risks, optimizing resource efficiency, and strengthening cloud-native resilience through automation."
