In cloud-native environments, tracking and visualizing the performance of containerized applications involves using tools to monitor container behavior, ensuring high reliability and efficient operation of applications within dynamically scalable microservices architectures. This is crucial for maintaining system stability and optimizing resource allocation, and is widely applied in high-load scenarios such as e-commerce or finance.

Core components include metrics collection systems (e.g., Prometheus for collecting CPU/memory data), log aggregation chains (e.g., EFK stack for log processing), distributed tracing frameworks (e.g., Jaeger for tracking request paths), and visualization interfaces (e.g., Grafana for generating dashboards). These elements enhance observability through real-time data integration, based on principles of automatic collection and AI analysis, helping to quickly identify bottlenecks, reduce downtime, and drive operational automation and cost savings.

Implementation steps include: deploying monitoring agents (e.g., Prometheus Operator), configuring metrics sources and trace injection, building visualization dashboards, and setting up alerts. Typical scenarios include troubleshooting and performance tuning, with business value such as reducing MTTR by 50%, improving user experience, and enhancing compliance.
