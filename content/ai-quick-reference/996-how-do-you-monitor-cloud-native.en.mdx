Real-time monitoring of security vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications refers to the continuous and automated detection of potential weaknesses in applications within cloud platforms and containerized environments. Its importance lies in the timely prevention of data breaches, service disruptions, and compliance violations. Application scenarios include continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in DevSecOps processes and security operations of Kubernetes clusters.

Core components include image scanning tools (such as Clair), runtime security monitoring (such as Falco), and log analysis systems. The principle is based on dynamic risk detection and automated response mechanisms. In practical applications, these tools are integrated into cloud-native architectures to achieve real-time threat visibility, significantly reducing the attack surface and improving the overall security posture.

Implementation steps: Deploy image scanners to scan container vulnerabilities; set up runtime security agents to monitor abnormal behaviors; integrate alert systems to send real-time notifications. Typical scenarios involve using Prometheus and Grafana in Kubernetes to visualize data. Business values include reducing operational risks, ensuring compliance requirements are met, enhancing user trust, and improving business continuity.
