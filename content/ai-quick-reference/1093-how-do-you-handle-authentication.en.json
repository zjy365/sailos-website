  "content": "In a multi-cloud environment, authentication is used to verify the identity of users or services, while authorization determines their resource access permissions. This is crucial as it ensures secure access to resources across platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, prevents data breaches, and meets compliance requirements. Application scenarios include enterprises uniformly managing employee access or cross-cloud communication between automated services.\n\nThe core solution is based on identity federation and standardized protocols (such as SAML/OIDC), integrating a central identity provider (such as Azure AD or Keycloak) for centralized authentication. Fine-grained permission policies are defined through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and authorization decisions are synchronized across platforms. This reduces management complexity, improves audit efficiency, and supports single sign-on scenarios.\n\nPractical implementation steps: 1) Deploy a central IdP and configure federation trust; 2) Integrate the IdP with each cloud platform (e.g., AWS IAM Identity Center); 3) Define RBAC policies and map them to cloud services; 4) Monitor logs to ensure compliance. Business values include reducing security risks, optimizing operational costs by 20%, and enhancing users' cross-cloud experience."
