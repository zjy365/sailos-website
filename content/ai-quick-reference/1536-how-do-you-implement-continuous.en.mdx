Continuous monitoring of cloud-native applications ensures real-time tracking of application performance and health status. Its importance lies in guaranteeing high reliability, rapid fault response, and performance optimization. Application scenarios include microservice architectures and containerized environments such as Kubernetes clusters.

It is core-based on observability principles, including metrics monitoring (such as CPU/memory metrics), log aggregation, and distributed tracing. Common tools include Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger. In practical applications, it improves system transparency, supports automated operation and maintenance, quickly locates problems, and enhances the efficiency of DevOps practices.

Implementation steps: 1. Select and deploy a monitoring toolset (such as CNCF ecosystem tools). 2. Configure the application to expose monitoring endpoints. 3. Set up real-time alerts and dashboards. 4. Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated monitoring. Typically used in microservice scenarios, its business value is to reduce downtime, optimize resource utilization, and improve user experience.
