  "content": "In microservices architecture, cross-platform communication challenges refer to obstacles in network interactions when services run on different operating systems or cloud environments, such as inconsistent data formats and network latency. Their importance lies in ensuring the reliability and resilience of distributed systems, with application scenarios including multi-cloud deployed applications (e.g., e-commerce services calling between AWS and Azure) to support rapid iteration and scalability.\n\nCore coping strategies include adopting standard protocols (such as RESTful API or gRPC) for unified interfaces, service discovery mechanisms (based on Kubernetes' Service abstraction) to automatically locate service endpoints, and API Gateway to aggregate and validate requests. Asynchronous communication handles non-real-time interactions through message queues (such as Kafka), and Service Mesh (such as Istio) enhances traffic management and security. These components improve communication efficiency and reduce platform dependency.\n\nPractical implementation steps: Define clear API contracts; deploy service discovery (e.g., Kubernetes Service); integrate API Gateway (e.g., Nginx); add message queues for asynchrony. The business value is to improve system interoperability, reduce failure points, support seamless scaling and cost optimization, especially achieving efficient resource utilization in hybrid cloud environments."
