First paragraph: Data deduplication refers to the technology of identifying and eliminating duplicate data copies, storing only a single instance. In cloud-native data management, this can significantly reduce storage costs, optimize resource utilization, and improve scalability and efficiency; application scenarios include large-scale backup systems, multi-tenant data lakes, and real-time analytics pipelines.

Second paragraph: The core principle is based on content-defined chunking technology and hash algorithms (such as SHA-256), which detect duplicates by comparing data chunks to generate unique fingerprints and store reference metadata. Key features include incremental processing, high compression ratio, and scalable indexing; practical applications are in object storage services (e.g., AWS S3 or Ceph), integrated with Kubernetes persistent volume controllers to support dynamic volume provisioning and seamless data sharing.

Third paragraph: Implementing data deduplication requires the following steps: 1) Deploy a data deduplication layer in the storage system, such as using MinIO or dedicated plugins; 2) Integrate data ingestion pipelines to automatically scan and compare input data; 3) Maintain a metadata index to ensure quick access. A typical scenario is containerized application log storage, with business values of cost reduction by over 30% and accelerated IO performance.
