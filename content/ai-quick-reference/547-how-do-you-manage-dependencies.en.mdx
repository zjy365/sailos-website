In a microservices architecture, the management of dependencies between services involves coordinating the interaction mechanisms of independent services to ensure reliable communication and prevent system-level failures. Its importance lies in enhancing system scalability and availability, making it suitable for highly dynamic distributed environments such as e-commerce and financial services.

The core components include service discovery (e.g., Consul or Eureka), circuit breaker patterns (e.g., Hystrix), and API gateways (e.g., Kong). It is characterized by loose coupling and automatic elastic mechanisms. In practical applications, it reduces the risk of single points of failure, with impacts including enhanced fault tolerance and support for agile iteration.

Implementation steps: First, deploy a service registry to enable automatic service discovery; second, integrate circuit breakers to intercept dependency failures; finally, configure an API gateway to uniformly handle routing and permissions. A typical scenario is an order processing system, with business values including reducing downtime losses and optimizing developer productivity.
