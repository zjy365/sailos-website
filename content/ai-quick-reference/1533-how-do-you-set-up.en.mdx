Alert rules in cloud-native monitoring systems are mechanisms that trigger notifications based on predefined metric conditions, ensuring system reliability and rapid fault response. Their importance lies in improving the availability of cloud-native applications (such as Kubernetes clusters), being applied to monitor service health, resource anomalies (e.g., CPU overload or service interruptions), and preventing business disruptions.

The core components include metric collection tools (e.g., Prometheus), rule definition engines (supporting multi-metric composite logic), and notification systems (e.g., Alertmanager). Features involve threshold setting, sliding window calculation, and time window triggering; practical applications can automate operational decisions, with impacts including optimizing resource usage and enhancing the efficiency of multi-service chain monitoring.

Implementation steps: 1. Select and define key metrics (e.g., pod error rate); 2. Set thresholds and conditions (e.g., error rate > 10% for 5 consecutive minutes); 3. Configure notification channels (Slack or email); 4. Test rules and iterate for optimization. Its business value reduces downtime, improves operational efficiency, and enhances user experience.
