  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to automatically manage computing resources through machine-readable definition files (such as configuration files or scripts) rather than manual operations. It enhances the consistency and repeatability of infrastructure deployment, reduces human errors, and is the core of cloud-native and DevOps practices. Its importance lies in supporting fast and reliable cloud environment management, applicable to scenarios such as automated application deployment, disaster recovery, and multi-cloud strategies.\n\nThe core components include a declarative programming model (describing the desired state) and version control systems (e.g., Git). Key features are automated resource configuration, change tracking, and orchestration capabilities. In practical applications, IaC eliminates configuration drift, enables \"\"immutable deployment\"\" of infrastructure, significantly impacts software delivery efficiency, supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes, and empowers agile development and elastic scaling.\n\nCommonly used tools include Terraform (multi-cloud orchestration), AWS CloudFormation (AWS native), Azure Resource Manager (Azure specific), Ansible (configuration management), and Pulumi (multi-language support). Its values include reducing operational costs and accelerating time-to-market. Implementation steps typically involve: defining infrastructure as code files (e.g., Terraform's .tf files), integrating version control, and automating testing and deployment. This brings enterprises improved scalability management and disaster recovery capabilities."
