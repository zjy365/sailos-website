  "content": "Cloud-native storage is a storage technology based on cloud-native architecture, emphasizing elastic scalability, automated operation and maintenance, and containerized integration. It is crucial in IoT data management for efficiently processing massive, real-time device data streams, with application scenarios including smart home sensor data analysis and industrial IoT edge computing.\n\nIts core components include distributed storage systems, dynamic configuration mechanisms (such as Kubernetes CSI plugins), and high durability features like data replication and automatic fault tolerance. In practical applications, it supports real-time ingestion, historical storage, and disaster recovery of IoT data, improves resource utilization, responds to load fluctuations through elastic expansion, reduces latency, and enhances system reliability.\n\nIn terms of function, cloud-native storage provides a scalable and fault-tolerant storage foundation for IoT data platforms, ensuring data consistency and fast access. Its value lies in optimizing storage costs, accelerating data-driven decision-making, and enabling innovative applications such as predictive maintenance and large-scale device management."
