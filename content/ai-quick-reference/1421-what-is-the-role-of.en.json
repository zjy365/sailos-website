  "content": "OpenTelemetry is an open-standard telemetry toolset used to unify the collection of logs, metrics, and tracing data. It is crucial in cloud-native observability, enhancing the visibility and debugging efficiency of distributed systems, and is particularly suitable for microservices and containerized environments such as Kubernetes.\n\nIts core includes SDK, API, and OTP protocols, supporting multi-language instrumentation for automatic data generation. Through standardized transmission, it simplifies performance monitoring and fault diagnosis, significantly improving the reliability and operational efficiency of cloud-native applications and facilitating agile development.\n\nIn cloud-native observability, it provides end-to-end visibility, simplifies monitoring architectures, and supports real-time insights into business health. This brings business values such as standardization, scalability, and rapid fault recovery."
