Cloud-native environments enable agile deployment through containerization and microservices. Ensuring security best practices is crucial to prevent data breaches and comply with regulatory requirements (such as GDPR), with application scenarios including cloud application deployment in high-risk industries like financial services and healthcare.

Core security components involve identity management (e.g., Kubernetes RBAC), network segmentation (using service meshes like Istio), configuration security (e.g., Immutable Infrastructure), and continuous vulnerability scanning (integrated tools like Falco). These are based on the zero-trust principle, and in practical applications, overall defense is enhanced through automated monitoring, reducing internal threats and strengthening the impact of compliance frameworks.

Implementation steps include adopting DevSecOps processes (CI/CD integrated with Trivy scanning), configuring least privilege access, deploying runtime protection, and regularly auditing policies. Typical scenarios include automatic vulnerability remediation, with business values such as reducing risk costs, improving system resilience, and maintaining compliant operational efficiency.
