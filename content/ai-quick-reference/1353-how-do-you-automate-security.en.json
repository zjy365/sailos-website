  "content": "Automating security audits in CI/CD pipelines refers to integrating security tools into the continuous integration/deployment process to automatically scan code, dependencies, and configurations to prevent vulnerabilities from going live. It is crucial as it reduces security risks, accelerates delivery, and is applied in DevOps environments to ensure software supply chain security.\n\nThe core components include Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and container security tools, characterized by automated trigger scanning and instant feedback mechanisms. In practical applications, integrating toolchains (such as SonarQube or Trivy) into Jenkins or GitHub Actions significantly improves vulnerability detection efficiency and reduces compliance costs.\n\nImplementation steps: Select appropriate scanning tools; configure CI/CD scripts to trigger scans (e.g., during the code commit phase); set security gate thresholds as failure conditions; generate reports and alerts. A typical scenario is automatic scanning before building, with business value including reducing pre-production risks, accelerating release cycles, and enhancing audit compliance."
