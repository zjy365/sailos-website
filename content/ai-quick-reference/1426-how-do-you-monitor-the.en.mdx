Kubernetes cluster health monitoring refers to evaluating the operational status of components such as nodes, Pods, and services in the cluster to ensure high availability and performance. Its importance lies in maintaining the continuous operation of business applications and is applied in运维 scenarios such as fault detection, performance optimization, and auto-scaling.

The core components include node health checks, Pod lifecycle monitoring, collection of resource metrics (such as CPU and memory), and event log tracking. Features involve real-time data sampling and alarm mechanisms. In practical applications, it can identify node failures and resource bottlenecks early, support rolling update decisions, and significantly improve cluster reliability and运维 efficiency.

Implementation steps: Deploy Prometheus to collect monitoring data and configure Grafana visualization dashboards; set up Alertmanager alarm rules to monitor anomalies; regularly check node status and Pod readiness; analyze cluster event logs. A typical scenario is the operation and maintenance team responding to problems in real-time; business value includes reducing downtime losses and enhancing application reliability.
