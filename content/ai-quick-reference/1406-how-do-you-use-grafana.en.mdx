Grafana is an open-source monitoring and visualization platform that can visualize performance metrics of cloud-native applications, such as resource usage and latency. Cloud-native applications run in containerized environments like Kubernetes, where monitoring is crucial for their availability, performance, and rapid response to failures, especially in dynamic scaling and high-availability scenarios. This improves operational efficiency and application reliability.

Its core consists of data source integration (e.g., metrics collection by Prometheus), dashboard builder (custom charts and panels), and alerting rules. Supporting multiple data sources through plugins, Grafana displays the principle of metric data in real-time, helping monitor the health status of Kubernetes Pods or microservices. In practical applications, it provides real-time insights into resource consumption (e.g., CPU/memory), service latency, etc., significantly enhancing the fault diagnosis capability and automated operation level of DevOps teams.

Implementation steps include: deploying Prometheus or other metric collectors; installing Grafana; configuring data sources in the Grafana UI; importing pre-built dashboard templates (e.g., Kubernetes monitoring templates); setting up alerting rules and configuring notification channels (e.g., Slack). A typical scenario is real-time monitoring of abnormal container resource usage, and the business values include optimizing resource utilization, reducing downtime, and enhancing full-stack observability.
