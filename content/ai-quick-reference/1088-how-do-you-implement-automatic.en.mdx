Cross-cloud automatic failover refers to the system automatically switching traffic to a backup cloud platform when the primary cloud service is interrupted, ensuring business continuity. Its core value lies in eliminating single cloud vendor risk, meeting strict Service Level Agreement requirements, and is suitable for mission-critical applications and global services.

Its core components include: identical application replicas deployed in a multi-cloud environment, a global load balancer, continuous health check probes, and a failure detection mechanism. The principle is to monitor the status of each cloud instance in real-time through health checks. Once a primary cloud failure is confirmed, the global load balancer automatically updates DNS resolution or routing rules to seamlessly direct traffic to healthy backends, achieving business-imperceptible switching. The key lies in data synchronization, state sharing, and low-latency switching decisions.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy applications and data synchronization across multiple cloud platforms; 2. Configure the global load balancer and set health check policies; 3. Define failover thresholds; 4. Test the switching process. A typical application scenario is a high-availability e-commerce platform, where its business value lies in maximizing system availability and reducing downtime losses.
