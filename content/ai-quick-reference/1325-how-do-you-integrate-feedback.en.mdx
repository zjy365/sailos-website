Feedback loops in CI/CD pipelines are mechanisms that automatically collect development process data and quickly respond to improvements. They are crucial for cloud-native and Kubernetes environments, accelerating problem detection, enhancing software quality and iteration efficiency, and are applied in continuous delivery scenarios such as microservice deployment.

The core includes monitoring tool integration (e.g., Prometheus for metric collection), automated testing phases (unit and end-to-end testing), and post-deployment feedback points (log analysis via ELK stack). The principle is to achieve a real-time data closed loop through CI/CD toolchains (Jenkins or GitLab CI), directly feeding back failures or performance issues to the team; in practical applications, the impact is shortening the repair cycle, reducing downtime, and promoting DevOps collaboration.

Implementation steps: 1. Add automated testing and code scanning in the CI phase; 2. Integrate monitoring and alerting after CD deployment; 3. Collect user feedback using dashboards or tools; 4. Iterative optimization driven by feedback data analysis. A typical scenario is using Helm for Kubernetes deployment, with business value in reducing failure rates, increasing release frequency, and improving user satisfaction.
