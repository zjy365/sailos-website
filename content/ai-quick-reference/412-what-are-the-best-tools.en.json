  "content": "Microservices is an architectural pattern that splits applications into independent, deployable services, enhancing agility, scalability, and fault isolation. Its importance lies in supporting rapid iteration and elastic scaling, widely used in cloud-native scenarios such as e-commerce platforms and real-time data processing systems.\n\nCore features include loosely coupled communication, service discovery, and API gateways. The principle relies on distributed system theory, utilizing containerization for efficient resource management. In practical applications, microservices promote DevOps practices, drive continuous integration/deployment, and significantly optimize software development and运维 efficiency.\n\nBest tools include Kubernetes for container orchestration, Istio for service mesh management, Docker for simplifying container deployment, and Spring Boot as a development framework. The application value lies in automated lifecycle management, providing monitoring, security, and elastic scaling, which significantly improve the reliability and business response speed of microservices."
