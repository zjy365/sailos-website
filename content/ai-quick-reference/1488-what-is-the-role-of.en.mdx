Kubernetes monitoring involves continuously tracking cluster status, container performance, and resource usage using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. Its importance lies in ensuring high availability and reliability of applications by identifying root causes of failures and preventing downtime. It is applied in the operation and maintenance of containerized applications in production environments, such as load balancing adjustments under microservice architectures.

The core components include metric collection (e.g., CPU/memory metrics), log aggregation, and alert systems. Features include real-time data analysis, auto-scaling responses, and distributed tracing principles. In practical applications, it helps operation and maintenance teams quickly diagnose bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation; its impact on related fields includes improving system observability, reducing Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), and promoting automation in the cloud-native ecosystem.

Its application ensures application stability, and its value lies in achieving continuous availability through warning thresholds and health checks. Business values include reducing downtime losses, improving user experience, supporting Service Level Objectives (SLOs), promoting reliable releases and fault self-healing, and enhancing overall business resilience.
