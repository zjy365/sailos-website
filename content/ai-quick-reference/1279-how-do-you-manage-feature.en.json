  "content": "Feature flags are a technology for dynamically controlling the activation and deactivation of features. They ensure safe deployment in CI/CD pipelines, support canary releases, A/B testing, and reduce release risks, making them suitable for agile development and high-availability scenarios.\n\nThe core components include flag storage (such as configuration management services), API interfaces, and trigger integration. In CI/CD pipelines, flag states are saved during the build and testing phases and switched through automated processes after deployment. In practical applications, they reduce the impact of failures, improve testing efficiency, and accelerate iteration speed.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Embed flag key-values in the code; 2. Store and verify states during the CI phase; 3. Activate via management interfaces or scripts after deployment. Typical scenarios include phased rollout of new features. The business value lies in accelerating releases, improving quality, and optimizing user experience."
