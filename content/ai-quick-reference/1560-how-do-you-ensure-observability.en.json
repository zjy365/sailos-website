  "content": "Observability tools collect metrics, logs, and tracing data to monitor application performance; data privacy regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA) require the protection of users' personal information. The importance of ensuring compliance includes avoiding legal fines, maintaining user trust, and applying it to cloud-native environments such as microservice monitoring scenarios.\n\nCore components include data minimization (collecting only necessary information), anonymization techniques (desensitizing sensitive fields), access control (RBAC permissions), and end-to-end encryption. In practical applications, these features reduce the risk of non-compliance, support cross-industry audits, and improve the efficiency of compliance reporting.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Identify the flow of sensitive data; 2) Deploy desensitization tools; 3) Set up fine-grained access policies; 4) Regularly review regulatory updates. Typically used in financial or medical fields, it brings business value such as reducing penalty costs and enhancing brand reputation."
