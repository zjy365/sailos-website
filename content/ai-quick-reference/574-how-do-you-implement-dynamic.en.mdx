Dynamic configuration management allows real-time configuration updates in microservice architectures without restarting services, enhancing flexibility and maintainability, and supporting agile development and multi-environment deployments in cloud-native environments (such as development, testing, and production).

The core includes configuration servers for storing configuration data, client SDK integration with pull mechanisms, and change notifications (such as long polling or event-driven). Features include dynamic refresh, environment isolation, and version control. Practical applications are implemented through tools like Spring Cloud Config or Kubernetes ConfigMaps, significantly optimizing continuous delivery processes and error recovery capabilities.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy a configuration center to store configurations; 2. Integrate client libraries (such as Spring Cloud or Envoy) into microservices; 3. Set up change listeners to refresh via Webhooks or APIs; 4. Verify and deploy changes. Business values include reducing downtime risks and improving resource utilization, suitable for scenarios like parameter adjustments or feature toggling.
