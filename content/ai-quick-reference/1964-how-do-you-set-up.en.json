  "content": "Secure communication between services in cloud native refers to protecting data transmission between microservices through encryption technologies to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Its importance lies in preventing data leakage and man-in-the-middle attacks. Application scenarios include microservice interactions in Kubernetes environments, such as API gateway and service calls.\n\nCore components include mutual TLS (mTLS), service meshes (e.g., Istio), and identity management systems. Based on the principle of certificate authentication, it enables end-to-end encrypted transmission. In practical applications, service meshes automate certificate management, policy enforcement, and traffic control, significantly enhancing security defense capabilities and reducing the attack surface.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy service mesh tools; configure global mTLS authentication; set role-based access control policies. Typical scenarios include internal service requests. Business values include reducing security risks, simplifying compliance audits, and improving application availability and manageability through reliable encrypted communication."
