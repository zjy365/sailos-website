Microservices is an architectural pattern that decomposes applications into independently deployable services. Implementing security best practices is crucial to prevent data breaches, denial-of-service attacks in distributed environments, and ensure compliance, suitable for high-demand scenarios such as e-commerce and finance.

Core practices include adopting a zero-trust model, inter-service encryption (e.g., mTLS), API gateways for access control, service meshes (e.g., Istio) for authentication and authorization, and continuous monitoring. These components enhance overall security during runtime, reduce the attack surface, strengthen threat response through log auditing and anomaly detection, and particularly promote the resilience of cloud-native applications in containerized deployments.

Implementation steps: First, design a security baseline including least privilege and service isolation; second, integrate API gateways and certificate management; then deploy real-time monitoring tools for vulnerability scanning; finally, conduct regular audits and updates. A typical scenario involves payment gateways, with business value lying in protecting sensitive data, reducing risks, supporting regulatory compliance, and enhancing system credibility.
