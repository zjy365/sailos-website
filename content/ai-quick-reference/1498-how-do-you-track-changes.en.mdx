Observability tools, such as log aggregation (e.g., Fluentd), metrics monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), and tracing systems (e.g., Jaeger), are crucial in cloud-native environments. They provide real-time insights into system status and the impact of changes, ensure high availability, support continuous deployment (CI/CD), and are applied to fault diagnosis and performance optimization in microservice architectures.

Their core includes logging to capture operational details, metrics to measure resource changes, and tracing to link request flows. Through data aggregation and visualization, these tools enable anomaly detection and root cause analysis, enhance system reliability and agility, and are widely used in performance tuning and incident response during version iterations.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate logging tools to record update events; 2. Configure metric alerts to monitor key changes; 3. Use tracing tools to map transaction flows. Typical scenarios include evaluating latency impact after deployment, and business values include reducing downtime risks, enhancing traceability, and accelerating release processes.
