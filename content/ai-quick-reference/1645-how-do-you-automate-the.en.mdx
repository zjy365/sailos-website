IaC tools (such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation) use code files to define infrastructure and automate the deployment of virtual machines instead of manual operations. Their importance lies in improving deployment speed, ensuring environment consistency, and reducing human errors, making them suitable for operation and maintenance scenarios involving rapid resource scaling in cloud computing platforms (such as AWS or Azure).

The core components include declarative configuration files (such as .tf files) that describe VM specifications (CPU, storage), state management mechanisms to track resource changes, and execution engines that compare planned and actual states. The principle is to achieve automated management through modular code, support version control, thereby improving operation and maintenance efficiency, supporting CI/CD processes, and reducing operational risks.

Implementation steps are: 1. Write IaC scripts to define VM parameters (such as image, network); 2. Initialize the tool environment and configure authentication; 3. Execute the ""apply"" command to deploy virtual machines and monitor their status. Typical scenarios include continuous deployment of development and testing environments; business values include minute-level deployment, reduced error rates, and optimized resource costs.
