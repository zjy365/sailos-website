Orchestration refers to the automated process of coordinating and managing components of a distributed system, playing a central role in automated deployment. Its importance lies in ensuring the orderly and efficient execution of deployment tasks, enhancing reliability and resource utilization. Application scenarios include containerized service deployment (such as Kubernetes clusters) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) of cloud-native applications.

The core features of orchestration include declarative configuration, automatic scheduling, health checks, and fault recovery. The principle is to achieve service coordination, load balancing, and elastic scaling through tools like Kubernetes. In practical applications, it simplifies complex deployment processes, supports dynamic management of microservice architectures, significantly reduces manual intervention, and improves system availability and operational efficiency, having a profound impact on the cloud-native domain.

In automated deployment, orchestration coordinates deployment steps (such as starting containers and service connections), ensuring consistency and reducing errors. Its values include accelerating delivery cycles, enhancing scalability, lowering operational risks, and achieving business agility and cost optimization.
