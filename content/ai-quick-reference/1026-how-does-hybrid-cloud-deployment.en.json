  "content": "Hybrid cloud deployment integrates private and public cloud resources to enhance the flexibility and business continuity of IT systems, making it particularly suitable for application scenarios with fluctuating demands, such as e-commerce or disaster recovery. By unifying the management of cross-cloud platforms, it addresses the issue of resource bottlenecks in a single environment.\n\nIts core features include dynamic resource allocation and load balancing mechanisms, enabling seamless scalability through APIs. When local private cloud resources are insufficient, the load is automatically offloaded to the public cloud, enhancing horizontal scalability to effectively handle sudden traffic surges and optimize operational efficiency.\n\nHybrid cloud significantly improves scalability and enables elastic scaling: first, define scaling policies, such as triggering public cloud resource expansion based on monitoring metrics; second, execute migrations through automation tools; in practical applications, for example, expand computing capacity during shopping peaks to reduce costs while maintaining high performance."
