IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates the management of cloud infrastructure such as VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and subnets through code, ensuring configuration consistency and repeatability. Its importance lies in reducing human errors, improving efficiency, and it is applicable to cloud network deployment scenarios such as cross-region resource isolation and multi-tenant environment construction.

The core components include IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, characterized by declarative syntax, version control, and modular templates. In practical applications, users define VPC CIDR blocks, subnet route tables, and security group rules through code, supporting dynamic resource provisioning. Its impact on cloud networks is reflected in automated operation and maintenance, rapid environment replication, and seamless DevOps integration, enhancing overall reliability and agility.

Implementation steps include using Terraform to write configuration files defining VPC properties and subnet segmentation, managing versions through Git; running `terraform apply` to execute deployment; and continuously monitoring changes. Typical scenarios involve hybrid cloud network expansion or disaster recovery setup, with business values including reducing manual maintenance costs, improving resource utilization, and strengthening security frameworks.
