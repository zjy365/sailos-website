  "content": "Data migration to the cloud is a systematic process of transferring data from on-premises systems to cloud storage or cloud services, which is crucial for supporting business flexibility, cost optimization, and digital transformation. Its importance includes enhancing scalability and disaster recovery capabilities, with application scenarios covering cloud-native application deployment, data analysis, and big data workload migration.\n\nThe core components involve migration strategies such as lift-and-shift or refactoring, data security mechanisms like encryption, and dedicated tools such as AWS DMS or Azure Data Factory. This process impacts the integration of cloud-native architectures, facilitates efficient access to Kubernetes-based containerized applications, and enables observability and automated management.\n\nImplementation steps include assessing data sources and target cloud platforms; selecting migration tools and planning strategies such as phased migration; executing migration and conducting data validation; optimizing cloud resource configuration. Business value is reflected in enhanced resilience, reduced operational costs by 25-50%, and accelerated deployment of innovative scenarios."
