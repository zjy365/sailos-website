In a microservices architecture, managing security is a key challenge. Due to the distributed nature increasing the attack surface and communication risks, its importance includes protecting data privacy, ensuring compliance (such as GDPR), and applying to sensitive scenarios like finance and e-commerce.

The core components include API gateways (for entry access control), service meshes (such as Istio for implementing inter-service TLS encryption and policy management), authentication and authorization mechanisms (such as OAuth 2.0 and JWT), and secret management (securely storing credentials through Vault). In practical applications, combining Kubernetes to implement network policies and service isolation significantly improves resilience, reduces cross-service vulnerabilities, and promotes the implementation of the zero-trust model in cloud-native environments.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy a central authentication service; 2. Configure API gateways to restrict external access; 3. Integrate service meshes to enhance internal communication; 4. Apply secret management tools; 5. Enable monitoring and audit logs. Business values include reducing attack risks, optimizing system reliability, and supporting business agility and compliance requirements.
