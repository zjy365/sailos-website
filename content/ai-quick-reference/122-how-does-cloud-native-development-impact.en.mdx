Cloud-native development builds applications based on cloud computing models, emphasizing elasticity and agility, promoting efficient resource utilization and rapid iteration. Its importance lies in supporting high availability, cost optimization, and continuous innovation, with wide applications in microservice architectures and container platforms, such as e-commerce or financial services in cloud environments.

Core features include containerization (e.g., Docker), microservice segmentation, continuous delivery, and automated orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes). This drives application architectures toward distributed, loosely coupled systems, improving scalability, fault isolation, and development efficiency. Practical impacts include simplifying multi-environment deployment, reducing dependencies on traditional monoliths, and enhancing monitoring and resilience through service meshes.

Business values include accelerated time-to-market, reduced operational costs, and enhanced scalability. Implementation steps: containerize applications, design independent microservices, integrate CI/CD and DevOps tools, suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as online transactions or real-time data processing.
