IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates infrastructure configuration through code, ensuring consistency and efficiency, where securely managing keys and credentials is crucial to prevent leaks. As a secure storage tool, HashiCorp Vault provides centralized secret management and is widely used in automated scenarios such as CI/CD pipelines, enhancing overall security and compliance.

Core features of Vault include dynamic secret generation, access policy control, and encryption services, which seamlessly integrate into IaC tools like Terraform via APIs. In applications, IaC scripts dynamically retrieve secrets through Terraform providers instead of hardcoding, which strengthens the automation reliability of workflows, reduces human errors, and supports large-scale cloud deployments and DevOps practices.

Implementation steps: First, install and configure the Vault server, define secret engines (such as K/V storage) and access policies; second, reference the Vault provider in Terraform to dynamically inject secrets into IaC code; finally, deploy and audit access logs. Typical business values are simplifying secret management, improving security and operational efficiency, and reducing audit burdens.
