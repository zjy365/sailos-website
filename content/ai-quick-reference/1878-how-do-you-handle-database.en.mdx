Cloud-native applications run in containerized environments, and database management ensures data persistence, high availability, and consistency. Its importance lies in supporting microservice elasticity and disaster recovery, with application scenarios including online transactions and real-time analytics.

Core components include Database as a Service (DBaaS) integration, Persistent Volumes (PVC), and automated Operators; the principle relies on data replication and sharding. In practical applications, zero-downtime migration and automatic backup are implemented to improve operational efficiency and system reliability.

When handling migration, the implementation steps are: evaluate the source database, set up real-time replication (such as CDC tools), switch traffic after verification, and monitor. Typical scenarios involve version upgrades or multi-cloud migration, with business values including zero downtime, cost optimization, and risk minimization.
