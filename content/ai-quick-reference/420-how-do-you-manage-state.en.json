  "content": "In a stateless microservices environment, service instances do not store local state when processing requests; instead, state is managed externally. This approach is crucial as it enhances system scalability, fault tolerance, and deployment agility, and is widely used in cloud-native applications (such as Kubernetes clusters) to support high concurrency and dynamic scaling scenarios.\n\nState management is implemented through external services, with core components including databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), caching systems (e.g., Redis), and message queues (e.g., Kafka), ensuring data persistence and consistency. The principle is that services call external storage through APIs, and state externalization promotes loose coupling. In practical applications, this facilitates session state sharing and event-driven design, significantly enhancing the maintainability and resilience of microservice architectures.\n\nImplementation steps: Identify state requirements (e.g., user data); integrate external storage (e.g., Kubernetes-configured managed databases); design APIs to encapsulate state access. A typical scenario is the use of Redis for e-commerce order management. Business values include cost reduction, improved reliability, and support for automatic scaling."
