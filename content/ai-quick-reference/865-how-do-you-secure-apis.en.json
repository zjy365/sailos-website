  "content": "OAuth2 is an open authorization standard framework used for securely delegating access rights without exposing credentials. It is crucial in cloud-native applications, ensuring secure communication across microservice APIs, complying with the zero-trust principle, and supporting the prevention of unauthorized access in multi-tenant cloud environments. Typical application scenarios include microservice interactions behind API gateways, user authentication integration, and mobile backend protection.\n\nThe core of OAuth2 includes client, authorization server, and resource server roles, supporting flows such as authorization code and client credentials. The principle is based on obtaining and verifying access tokens to achieve stateless authorization. In cloud-native architectures, it implements JWT verification through service meshes (e.g., Istio) or API gateways (e.g., Kong), with impacts including fine-grained access control, reduced attack surface, and improved compliance, making it particularly suitable for securing internal and external services in Kubernetes clusters.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy and configure an authorization server (e.g., Keycloak). Set up the API gateway to verify access tokens. Clients request tokens using appropriate flows. Typical scenarios include enhancing microservice isolation with Istio Envoy policies. Business value lies in strengthening security posture, simplifying user management, and facilitating scalable business logic."
