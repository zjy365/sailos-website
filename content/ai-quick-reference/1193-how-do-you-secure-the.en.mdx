Protecting edge devices in a multi-cloud environment requires ensuring the security of distributed infrastructure, with the core being unified security policies and a zero-trust architecture. Its importance lies in addressing risks such as high physical exposure of devices and expanded cross-cloud attack surfaces, applicable to edge computing scenarios like smart manufacturing and smart cities.

The implementation plan needs to cover three major levels: the device layer adopts hardware root of trust and secure boot mechanisms; the network layer establishes encrypted tunnel connections between different cloud platforms through VPN/IPSec; the management and control layer implements cross-cloud identity authentication and policy enforcement using service meshes (such as Istio). Key measures include: device mutual TLS authentication for identity verification, end-to-end encryption of data during transmission/at rest, and dynamic access control implementation based on cloud-native tools (such as OPA).

Specific implementation steps:

1. Issue a unique X.509 certificate for each device during the device provisioning phase

2. Deploy lightweight security proxies (such as Envoy) to handle encrypted communication

3. Establish a zero-trust policy engine in the cloud control plane

4. Real-time monitoring of abnormal behavior through audit logs

Business value is reflected in preventing data leakage, meeting compliance requirements (such as GDPR), and ensuring cross-cloud business continuity.
