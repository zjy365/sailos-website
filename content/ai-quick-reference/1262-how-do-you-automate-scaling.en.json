  "content": "CI/CD pipeline is an automated software delivery process that involves building, testing, and deploying applications. Auto-scaling refers to the system dynamically adjusting the number of instances based on demand to ensure high availability and resource optimization. This is crucial in cloud-native environments, such as Kubernetes clusters, for handling sudden traffic surges, ensuring service elasticity, improving development efficiency, and enhancing business continuity.\n\nCore components include CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI, combined with auto-scaling mechanisms such as Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). HPA automatically increases or decreases Pod instances based on CPU usage or custom metrics. In practical applications, integration during the deployment phase enables dynamic scaling after new version releases to respond to load changes; this reduces manual intervention, enhances system reliability, supports high-traffic scenarios, and drives the level of cloud-native automation.\n\nImplementation steps: After defining HPA policies in Infrastructure as Code, apply the configuration during the deployment phase of CI/CD scripts (e.g., kubectl commands). A typical scenario is automatically handling traffic spikes during releases. Business values include cost efficiency optimization through on-demand instance scaling and ensuring high availability to reduce downtime risks."
