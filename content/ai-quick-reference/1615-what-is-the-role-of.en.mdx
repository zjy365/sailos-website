Automation is the process of automatically executing tasks through tools, which is indispensable in the large-scale management of cloud-native applications. It improves efficiency, scalability, and reliability, reduces human errors, and is applicable to scenarios such as dynamic deployment and scaling under microservice architectures, such as Kubernetes clusters.

Its core components include continuous integration/deployment, auto-scaling, and health monitoring. The principle is based on declarative configuration and event-driven responses to achieve self-healing and consistent operations. The practical impact is optimizing resource utilization, shortening iteration cycles, and reducing operational complexity.

The application and value lie in that automation supports rapid release of updates, adaptive resource management, and high availability assurance, thereby enhancing business agility, reducing costs, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
