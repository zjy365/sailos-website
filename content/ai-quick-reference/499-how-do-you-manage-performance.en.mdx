A performance bottleneck in microservices refers to a point in a distributed system where a component (such as network communication or database access) causes an overall decline in performance. Managing these bottlenecks is crucial to ensuring high availability, responsiveness, and scalability, especially during traffic peaks such as in e-commerce platforms, to avoid user delays or service interruptions.

Core components include distributed tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger) and real-time monitoring (e.g., Prometheus) to identify the source of bottlenecks, such as inter-service latency or resource contention. Features involve optimizing asynchronous communication protocols and load balancing design, reducing call chain overhead through API gateways, enhancing system resilience and improving resource utilization, applied in cloud-native environments to reduce average response time.

Practical management steps are: first, deploy full-link monitoring tools to collect metrics; second, analyze logs to locate bottlenecks (e.g., DB queries); third, optimize code or introduce caching/CDN; finally, set up auto-scaling policies. Typical scenarios such as financial transaction systems can reduce error rates and improve user experience, bringing business value such as higher conversion rates.
