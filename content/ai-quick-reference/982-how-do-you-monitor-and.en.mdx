Cloud-native security risks refer to threats arising from misconfigurations, permission abuse, or vulnerabilities in dynamically scalable containerized and microservice architectures. Their importance lies in preventing data breaches and service disruptions, applicable to large-scale cloud computing and Kubernetes environments to ensure infrastructure resilience and compliance.

Core components include real-time monitoring tools like Falco, policy-as-code for runtime detection, log aggregation systems, and automated response mechanisms. By integrating with CI/CD pipelines, applications involve network traffic analysis and container behavior auditing, significantly enhancing security posture and reducing the impact of human errors.

Implementation steps involve deploying security agent clusters, configuring policy engines such as OPA, automating alert and remediation processes, and integrating audit logs. Typical scenarios include large-scale Kubernetes cluster management, with business values including reduced compliance risks, optimized response efficiency, and saved operational costs.
