Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is an asynchronous system pattern where components communicate through events rather than direct calls. In cloud-native applications, EDA is crucial as it enables loose coupling, high scalability, and resilience, suitable for microservice interactions, real-time data processing, and fault recovery scenarios.

The core components include event producers, consumers, and event brokers (such as Kafka or cloud service SQS), characterized by decoupling and on-demand scalability. In application, asynchronous tasks are processed through message queues to optimize resource utilization; deploying EDA in Kubernetes has a significant impact, enhancing system resilience and responsive microservice integration.

Implementation steps: 1. Identify event sources (e.g., API calls); 2. Deploy event brokers (using Kubernetes Operators or cloud-native tools); 3. Develop producers to send events; 4. Consumers subscribe and process. Typical scenarios include real-time inventory updates, with business values such as automatic scaling, cost efficiency, and fault isolation.
