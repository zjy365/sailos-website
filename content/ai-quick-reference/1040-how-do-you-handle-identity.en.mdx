In multi-cloud deployments, Identity and Access Management (IAM) ensures secure and compliant access for users and system entities across multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), preventing configuration inconsistencies and unauthorized access risks. Its importance lies in unifying security policies, reducing vulnerabilities, and supporting data protection for cross-cloud applications like hybrid workloads.

The core components include centralized identity sources (e.g., Azure Active Directory), federated authentication protocols (SAML/OIDC), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Features encompass single sign-on and policy synchronization, addressing cloud platform differences through unified identity bridging. Practical applications enable consistent authorization, enhance audit efficiency, and drive DevOps automation.

Implementation steps: First, deploy a central identity provider; second, configure federated identity integration across all clouds; third, define RBAC policies to unify permissions; finally, enable continuous monitoring and compliance auditing. Typical scenarios integrate multi-cloud resources, with business values including strengthened security, reduced operational costs, and accelerated compliance response.
