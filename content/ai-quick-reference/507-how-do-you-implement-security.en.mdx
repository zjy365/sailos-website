Microservice communication refers to data exchange between services, employing security protocols such as TLS/mTLS to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Its importance lies in preventing unauthorized access and data leakage, particularly supporting the zero-trust principle in cloud-native architectures. Application scenarios include distributed systems, Kubernetes environments, and API-driven microservice applications, enhancing the overall security baseline and compliance.

Core components include Transport Layer Security (TLS/mTLS) providing end-to-end encryption, service meshes (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) automating policy enforcement, and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2/JWT). Features involve certificate management, key rotation, and network policies. In practical applications, these components are integrated into containerized platforms, simplifying security configuration and enabling zero-trust communication through service proxies. The impact is significant, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, enhancing observability, and promoting modern DevSecOps practices.

Implementation steps: 1) Assess risks and define security policies; 2) Deploy service mesh tools to automatically enable mTLS; 3) Configure API gateways for request authorization. A typical scenario is one-step encryption implemented by Istio in Kubernetes. Business value: Strengthen data protection, reduce non-compliance costs, and accelerate compliance audits.
