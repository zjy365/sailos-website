  "content": "Cloud-native network resources refer to the network infrastructure for containers and microservices, such as Kubernetes Pods and service ports. Preventing unauthorized access is crucial for ensuring data confidentiality, avoiding data leaks, and mitigating attacks, especially in multi-tenant environments or distributed applications.\n\nCore components include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), network security policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies), and service meshes (e.g., Istio). In principle, cross-Pod communication is restricted by defining permissions and traffic rules; in practice, inbound/outbound traffic can be managed granularly. Its impacts include enhanced isolation, support for compliance standards, and reduced potential vulnerabilities.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Configure RBAC in Kubernetes to define user/service account permissions; 2. Deploy Network Policies to specify allowed inter-Pod traffic; 3. Use service meshes to integrate TLS encryption and identity authentication. Typical scenarios include communication between microservices; business values include reduced security risks, ensured data integrity, and cost efficiency."
