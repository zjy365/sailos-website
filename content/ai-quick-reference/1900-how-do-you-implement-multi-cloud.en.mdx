Multi-cloud architecture is a strategy for cloud-native applications to adopt multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), enhancing application reliability by avoiding vendor lock-in and optimizing fault tolerance. Its importance lies in supporting cross-regional deployment, highly available systems, and compliance requirements, applicable to scenarios like e-commerce and the financial industry.

The core components include cross-cloud deployment of Kubernetes clusters, unified API gateways, and cloud-native tools (such as Prometheus monitoring), characterized by heterogeneous environment integration and elastic scaling. In practical applications, for example, disaster recovery is achieved through cross-cloud distribution of microservices, which improves business continuity and simplifies global expansion.

Implementation steps: first assess business requirements (such as high availability or cost targets), select a strategy (such as disaster recovery or load distribution), deploy CNCF projects (such as Cluster API) to achieve cross-cloud resource orchestration, and integrate load balancing and automatic failover. In typical scenarios, this reduces downtime risks and optimizes operational costs by 20%-30%.
