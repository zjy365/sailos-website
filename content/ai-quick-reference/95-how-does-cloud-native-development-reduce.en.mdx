Cloud-native development is an application building method based on containerization, microservices, and cloud services, aiming to enhance scalability and reliability. Its importance lies in eliminating the complex management of traditional infrastructure and reducing manual intervention; application scenarios include agile development, high-traffic services, and elastic systems such as e-commerce platforms and high-frequency trading systems.

The core components include container technologies (e.g., Docker), orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), microservice architecture, and serverless computing. These features automatically manage resources, enabling efficient allocation and scaling, thereby reducing hardware investment and maintenance costs; practical impacts include increasing resource utilization by up to 70% and reducing operational overhead by approximately 50% through automation.

Implementation steps include: encapsulating applications with containers, using Kubernetes for auto-scaling, and deploying continuous integration/delivery pipelines to automate releases. Typical scenarios such as dynamic load balancing reduce over-provisioning; business values include lowering infrastructure costs by 30%-60%, enhancing system resilience, and supporting rapid iteration.
