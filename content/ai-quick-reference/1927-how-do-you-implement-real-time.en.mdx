Cloud-native applications are built on containers and microservices, featuring elasticity and scalability; real-time analytics processes data streams to provide immediate insights. Their importance lies in supporting rapid decision-making, personalized user experiences, and risk management, with applications in scenarios such as e-commerce recommendations, financial risk control, and IoT monitoring.

Core components include stream data platforms (e.g., Apache Kafka), real-time processing engines (e.g., Apache Flink), and cloud-native infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes for container management). Features encompass low latency, high throughput, and automatic scalability. In practical applications, real-time analytics drives dynamic pricing and anomaly detection, significantly enhancing business agility and operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate real-time data sources (e.g., Kafka). 2. Deploy stream processing applications to Kubernetes clusters. 3. Configure elastic scaling to handle load fluctuations. 4. Output results to visualization dashboards. Typical scenarios include user behavior analysis, with business values including immediate optimization of marketing strategies and reduction of decision latency.
