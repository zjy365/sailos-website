State management is a core mechanism in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform for tracking the actual state of infrastructure. Its importance lies in ensuring deployment consistency and reproducibility, preventing configuration drift, and supporting auditing. Application scenarios include multi-environment automation and version control of infrastructure resources.

Core components include state files (e.g., .tfstate) that store resource IDs and attributes; features such as state locking to manage concurrent operations and avoid conflicts. The principle is that the tool compares the desired state defined in code with the actual state and plans additions, deletions, and modifications. In practical applications, remote backends (such as AWS S3 or Terraform Cloud) are adopted to improve team collaboration efficiency, enhance disaster recovery capabilities, and significantly reduce human errors.

In practice, it is handled by configuring a remote state backend (e.g., specifying a backend block in the code), enabling state locking (e.g., DynamoDB), and version-controlling the state file. Steps involve initializing Terraform (terraform init), running the application (terraform apply), and monitoring changes. A typical scenario is distributed team collaboration; business values include improving deployment reliability, scalability, and security.
