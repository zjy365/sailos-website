  "content": "In automated deployment, managing application configuration files is crucial as it ensures configuration consistency and security of applications across different environments (development, testing, production), serving as a key link in achieving reliable continuous deployment.\n\nThe core methods are configuration-code separation and environment-specific configuration. Configuration files are typically stored externally to avoid hardcoding into application images. Kubernetes natively uses ConfigMaps to store non-sensitive configurations and Secrets to manage sensitive data (which requires encryption); both are independent resources injected into containers via volumes or environment variables. Additionally, configuration management tools (such as Helm's `values.yaml`) enable templating, environment variable settings allow flexible overriding of configuration values, and GitOps tools (such as Argo CD) implement version control and automated synchronization of configuration changes.\n\nPractical steps: 1. Move configuration files out of the application code repository, store them in a dedicated repository, and version them. 2. Define configurations using ConfigMaps/Secrets, strictly adhering to naming conventions and environment labels. 3. Use Helm Charts or Kustomize for environment-specific configuration management. 4. Sensitive data must be stored via Secrets to ensure static encryption and least-privilege access. 5. Bind ConfigMaps/Secrets to application Deployments/DaemonSets during deployment. 6. Monitor the impact of configuration changes, and major updates require rolling restarts of associated application instances. This method improves deployment reliability and security, and supports rapid environment switching."
