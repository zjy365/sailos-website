Cloud-native development is an application building approach based on cloud computing principles, emphasizing containerization, microservices, and DevOps integration. Its importance lies in enhancing application elasticity, scalability, and maintainability, with application scenarios including cloud platforms and highly dynamic environments to optimize resource utilization.

Core features include container technologies (such as Docker), Kubernetes orchestration, microservice decoupling, and automated CI/CD processes. This leads IT infrastructure management to shift toward high automation, enabling dynamic scaling, self-healing, and policy-driven deployment, reducing manual intervention and improving overall reliability and efficiency.

This model simplifies infrastructure management by unifying operations through abstraction layers like service meshes; business values include reducing costs, accelerating innovation, and enhancing system resilience, supporting rapid business iteration.
