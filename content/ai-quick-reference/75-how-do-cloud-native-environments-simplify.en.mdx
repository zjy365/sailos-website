Cloud-native environments combine containers, microservices, and automation technologies to enhance the efficiency of application building and operation. Their importance lies in achieving high agility, scalability, and reliability, making them suitable for microservice architectures, hybrid cloud deployments, and continuous delivery scenarios.

Such environments automate container lifecycle management through container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, service meshes, and declarative configurations. Core features include resource scheduling, service discovery, and elastic scaling, which simplify container configuration, deployment, and maintenance, accelerate CI/CD pipelines, and reduce complexity. In practical applications, they promote DevOps practices and optimize resource utilization.

During implementation, tools such as Helm chart predefined templates and GitOps are used to achieve automated version control. The steps include integrating CI/CD platforms to build images, one-click deployment, and monitoring feedback. Business values include reducing manual operation time by 50%, accelerating time-to-market, and lowering operational costs.
