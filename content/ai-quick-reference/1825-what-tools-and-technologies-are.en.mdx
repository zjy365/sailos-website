Cloud-native application development is an approach to building scalable, elastic, and agile applications using cloud platforms. Its importance lies in improving resource efficiency, accelerating deployment speed, and it is suitable for microservice architecture and DevOps practice scenarios.

Common tools include Kubernetes for container orchestration, providing automated deployment and scaling; Docker for containerizing applications to ensure consistency; Helm for simplifying Kubernetes package management; and CI/CD tools like Jenkins for implementing continuous integration/delivery. Service Mesh such as Istio optimizes network communication, and monitoring tools like Prometheus enhance observability. These technologies support efficient application building and maintenance through standardized processes.

In development, tools are applied to automated testing, seamless release, and elastic scaling, with values including shortening time-to-market, improving system reliability, and reducing operational costs.
