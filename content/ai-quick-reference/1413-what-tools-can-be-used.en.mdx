Monitoring containerized applications is crucial for ensuring high availability, performance optimization, and rapid fault diagnosis. It is widely used in cloud-native environments to support dynamic scaling of microservices, DevOps automation, and resource efficiency.

Core tools include: Prometheus for metrics collection and alert management; Grafana for dashboard visualization; ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis; and tools like Datadog and Jaeger for end-to-end tracing and container health monitoring. These components support real-time data collection, container resource usage tracking, and insights into system behavior.

The application value of these tools lies in enhancing system observability, enabling automated anomaly detection, optimizing resource allocation, and reducing downtime, thereby ensuring business continuity and operational efficiency.
