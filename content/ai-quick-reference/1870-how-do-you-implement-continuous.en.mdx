Cloud-native applications are built on technologies such as containers, microservices, and Kubernetes to achieve elastic scaling and dynamic management. Continuous deployment uses automated processes to quickly push code changes to the production environment. Its importance lies in increasing release frequency and quality, and it is suitable for DevOps-driven agile development and cloud-native ecosystems to accelerate innovation and reduce the risk of human errors.

Core components include CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, version control, and GitOps principles. Features involve automatic building, testing, and deployment on Kubernetes after code commits, using tools like Jenkins or Argo CD. In practical applications, it ensures reliable updates, promotes seamless integration of cloud-native architectures such as microservices, significantly optimizes resource utilization, and enhances team collaboration.

Implementation steps: 1. Establish a CI/CD toolchain, integrating Git repositories, build tools, and testing frameworks. 2. Combine with Kubernetes to实现 automated deployment and rollback through GitOps or Helm. 3. Incorporate monitoring and alerting to ensure health. Typical scenarios include high-frequency service releases; business values are shortening delivery cycles, improving product stability, and enhancing user experience.
