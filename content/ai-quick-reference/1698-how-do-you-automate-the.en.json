  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates the configuration management of infrastructure and applications through scripts, while cloud-native monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana monitor containerized environments. Its importance lies in ensuring configuration consistency, repeatability, and efficiency, with application scenarios including the automatic deployment of monitoring stacks in dynamic cloud environments to support elastic applications.\n\nThe core includes IaC tools (such as Terraform) for declaratively defining monitoring resources, and monitoring components (such as Prometheus configuration files and Grafana dashboards) implemented in code via APIs or CLIs. The principle involves writing configuration scripts and integrating CI/CD pipelines. In practical applications, it automates the deployment of service discovery, alert rules, and dashboards, improving reliability and reducing human error rates.\n\nImplementation steps: Select an IaC tool, write monitoring configurations as code (defining resources and services), and integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. A typical scenario is automating the setup of Prometheus exporters in Kubernetes clusters. Business values include accelerating fault response, optimizing operation and maintenance costs, and improving system reliability."
