Cloud-native environments provide elasticity and scalability based on containerization and tools like Kubernetes. Implementing CI/CD pipelines enhances software delivery speed, reliability, and reduces human errors through automated integration and deployment, making them suitable for microservices development and distributed system scenarios.

Their core components include the CI phase (automated building and code testing) and the CD phase (automated deployment to production environments), with features such as environmental consistency, blue-green deployment, and rapid feedback loops; the principle is that container orchestration ensures seamless deployment. In practical applications, it shortens the development cycle, reduces failure rates, promotes agile development and continuous improvement, and significantly shortens time-to-market.

Benefits include accelerating release frequency, enhancing system stability, reducing operational costs, and promoting cross-team collaboration. This brings business value such as improving market responsiveness, optimizing resource utilization, and supporting innovation-driven competitive advantages.
