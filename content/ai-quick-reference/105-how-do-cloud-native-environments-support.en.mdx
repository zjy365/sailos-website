Cloud-native environments are based on containerization and cloud services, providing automation, elasticity, and observability. Monitoring containerized applications is crucial. Due to their high dynamism (containers start and stop frequently), monitoring involves real-time tracking of performance, logs, and metrics to ensure application availability and rapid fault response, widely used in modern DevOps and microservices architectures.

Core components include container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for dynamic resource management, metrics collection systems (e.g., Prometheus) for automated CPU/memory data collection, log aggregators (e.g., Fluentd) for unified log stream processing, and visualization tools (e.g., Grafana). In practical applications, implementing automatic discovery, distributed tracing, and alert notifications improves operational efficiency (e.g., rapid fault localization) and resource optimization (reducing cloud costs).

Implementation steps: 1) Deploy monitoring agents (e.g., Prometheus in the cluster); 2) Integrate log collection pipelines (configure Fluentd into the ELK stack); 3) Set up visualization and alert rules (using Grafana). Business values include reduced downtime, improved user experience, and lower costs, with typical scenarios such as real-time performance monitoring of e-commerce platforms.
