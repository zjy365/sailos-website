Automated deployment automatically executes the application release process through tools, ensuring deployment consistency and efficiency. It is crucial in modern software delivery, supporting rapid iteration and reliable releases, and is widely used in cloud-native, microservices architecture, and multi-environment deployment scenarios.

The core includes CI/CD pipelines, version control systems (such as Git), and automated deployment tools (such as Kubernetes operators). This enables precise version control, parallel environment management, and automatic rollback mechanisms, reducing human errors and improving deployment reliability, thereby efficiently managing multiple application versions.

Key steps for managing multiple versions: first, tag the application in version control; second, configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the specified version; finally, set up monitoring to trigger rollbacks. Typical scenarios include blue-green deployment and A/B testing, with business value reflected in reduced downtime, accelerated release cycles, and enhanced user experience.
