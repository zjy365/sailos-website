  "content": "In cloud-native applications, API token and credential management involves securely storing, accessing, and updating sensitive data such as API keys or identity tokens to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of applications in containerized environments like Kubernetes clusters. Its importance lies in preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations, applicable to scenarios such as microservice architectures, serverless computing, and CI/CD pipelines, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.\n\nCore components include the use of centralized key management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager), implementation of encrypted storage via Kubernetes Secrets, and support for dynamic injection, automatic rotation, and the principle of least privilege. Features like TLS-encrypted transmission and service mesh integration (e.g., Istio mTLS) ensure end-to-end security, and practical applications can optimize secret lifecycle management, significantly reduce exposure risks, and promote DevSecOps practices.\n\nImplementation steps include configuring Kubernetes Secrets encryption, integrating tools to dynamically obtain credentials (e.g., using Vault Agent or Sidecar mode), and setting up RBAC to control access. Typical scenarios include injecting credentials into Pods during deployment to avoid hardcoding; business values include reducing the probability of security incidents, enhancing compliance (e.g., GDPR), and improving operational efficiency."
