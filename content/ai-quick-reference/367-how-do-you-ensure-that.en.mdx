Ensuring that only tested and approved code is deployed in automated deployments is a key practice in DevOps. This is crucial as it reduces the risk of production failures and improves software quality. Application scenarios include continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, supporting agile development and rapid, reliable releases.

Core components include automated testing phases (such as unit and integration testing) and approval mechanisms (such as code reviews or automatic compliance checks). Features involve deployment gate control to ensure the process proceeds only when all conditions are met. In practical applications, configured through CI/CD tools like Jenkins, it enhances the predictability and security of delivery, significantly impacting software development and operational efficiency.

Implementation steps include: configuring the pipeline to add test scripts; integrating approval steps such as manual review triggers; and automatically deploying only after tests pass and approval is obtained. A typical scenario is the automated validation after development teams submit code. Business value includes reducing downtime, increasing deployment frequency while ensuring quality.
