Cloud-native CI/CD pipelines are continuous integration and continuous deployment processes based on cloud technologies such as containerization and Kubernetes, designed to automate the building, testing, and release of software. Their importance lies in accelerating delivery cycles, improving application reliability, and being suitable for cloud environment deployment of microservice architectures.

Core components include source code management triggering automatic builds, container image creation and storage, automated test suites, and deployment strategies (such as blue-green or canary releases). This pipeline emphasizes elasticity and scalability, enabling efficient development by reducing human errors and providing seamless integration for the cloud-native ecosystem.

Setup steps: 1. Select tools such as Argo CD or Tekton. 2. Define CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., YAML files). 3. Integrate Kubernetes clusters for rolling deployments. 4. Implement monitoring to optimize the process. A typical scenario is microservice updates, bringing business value such as shortened release times and enhanced system stability.
