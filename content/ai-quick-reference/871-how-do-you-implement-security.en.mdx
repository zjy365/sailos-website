Implementing security controls for containerized applications in Kubernetes involves strategies and mechanisms to ensure applications are protected from threats such as unauthorized access and data leakage during runtime. Its importance lies in maintaining data integrity, meeting compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR), and it is applicable to multi-tenant cloud environments and mission-critical business deployments.

Core components include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing user permissions, network policies for isolating traffic between Pods, Pod Security Policies for limiting container resources, image scanning tools (such as Trivy) for vulnerability checks, and runtime security monitoring (such as Falco). Features include fine-grained control and automated admission controllers; in practical applications, RBAC reduces privilege abuse, network policies prevent lateral attacks, and overall cluster resilience is enhanced.

Implementation steps: First, configure RBAC to define least-privilege roles and bindings; second, deploy network policies to restrict unnecessary inbound/outbound traffic; third, integrate image scanning into CI/CD pipelines; finally, enable Pod Security Policies or Admission controllers (such as OPA Gatekeeper), and combine with log auditing tools to monitor anomalies. Typical scenarios include microservice isolation, and business values include reducing vulnerability risks and achieving DevSecOps efficiency.
