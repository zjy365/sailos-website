Monitoring and tracking the reliability of cloud-native services in a hybrid cloud environment involves observing service health, performance, and operational flow consistency across multi-cloud deployments. Its importance lies in ensuring continuous service availability in complex architectures, reducing downtime risks, and applying to high-availability business scenarios such as financial transactions and e-commerce platforms.

The core includes unified monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus or Datadog), distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger), real-time log analysis, and cloud provider integration APIs. Features support multi-environment automatic discovery, AI-driven alert mechanisms, and end-to-end visibility. In practical applications, it can quickly diagnose faults, optimize resource allocation, and enhance system resilience, with impacts manifested as improved operational efficiency and security compliance.

Implementation steps: 1. Configure a centralized monitoring platform to integrate hybrid cloud nodes; 2. Deploy monitoring agents and tracing IDs in services; 3. Unify log collection and analysis processes; 4. Set up alert rules and integrate them into notification systems; 5. Conduct regular performance reviews and optimizations. A typical scenario is the linked deployment of Kubernetes clusters on AWS and private clouds, with business value including reducing downtime by over 30%, improving user experience, and enhancing rapid iteration capabilities.
