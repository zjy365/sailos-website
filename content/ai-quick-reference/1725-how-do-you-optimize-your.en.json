  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure management through code, improving deployment speed and reliability. Its importance lies in ensuring consistency and reducing human errors. It is applied in cloud environments such as Kubernetes cluster configuration and CI/CD pipelines, supporting rapid iteration and elastic scaling.\n\nCore components include code version control (e.g., Git), tools like Terraform or Ansible, and automated testing frameworks. The principle is to define infrastructure states based on code and integrate CI/CD to trigger automated deployments. In practical applications, this process reduces downtime risks through repeatable execution, enhances auditability, and accelerates cloud-native service delivery.\n\nOptimization steps: 1) Standardize modular code repositories; 2) Integrate automated testing (linting, compliance scanning); 3) Implement progressive deployment and monitoring. Business values include increasing deployment frequency, enhancing reliability, and reducing operational costs."
