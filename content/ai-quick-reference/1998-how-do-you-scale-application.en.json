  "content": "Cloud-native environment extended application architecture refers to dynamically adjusting resource scales on containerized platforms such as Kubernetes to adapt to changing demands. Its importance lies in enhancing application elasticity, availability, and efficiency, applied in high-fluctuation scenarios like e-commerce peak traffic and streaming media live broadcasts to ensure business continuity.\n\nCore components include horizontal scaling mechanisms such as Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which automatically increases or decreases Pod replicas based on CPU or custom metrics; features such as self-healing and load balancing, combined with service mesh to optimize traffic. In practical applications, scaling is triggered through real-time monitoring, with impacts including improved resource utilization and enhanced fault tolerance, supporting low-latency responses for global online services.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define resource requests and limits; 2. Configure HPA policies to set scaling thresholds; 3. Integrate Prometheus monitoring and alerting systems. Typical scenarios include elastic scaling during retail promotions. Business values include reducing cost waste, strengthening user experience SLA, and achieving automated scalability."
