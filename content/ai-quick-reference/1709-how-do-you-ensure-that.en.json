  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflow automates infrastructure management through code, testing across multiple environments to ensure consistency and reliability, thereby reducing deployment risks. Its importance lies in supporting continuous delivery, minimizing human errors, and being applied to multi-environment deployment scenarios in DevOps and cloud-native environments.\n\nCore components include testing strategies (such as unit testing and integration testing), environment isolation mechanisms (using independent sandbox environments), and tools (like Terraform, Jenkins) integrated with CI/CD pipelines. Features encompass automated validation, version control, and infrastructure as testing, with impacts including enhanced change security and accelerated iteration speed.\n\nImplementation steps: Define different environments (e.g., development, testing, production); write automated test cases; trigger the testing process through CI/CD integration; and promote changes after verifying results. Typical business values are reducing failure rates, accelerating release cycles, and optimizing operational efficiency."
