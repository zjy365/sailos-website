Infrastructure as Code (IaC) uses programming languages to define and automate infrastructure management, ensuring deployment consistency and repeatability. Its importance lies in reducing human errors, improving efficiency, and supporting agile development. Application scenarios include cloud environment deployments such as AWS or Azure, Kubernetes cluster setup, etc.

Core testing includes static analysis (e.g., code linting), unit testing to verify resource logic, and integration testing to execute deployments in a simulated environment. Tools include Terraform's validate or Inspec, integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect issues. The practical impact is enhancing configuration reliability, preventing production failures, and strengthening security compliance.

Implementation steps: first, run static checks locally; then deploy to a staging environment for integration testing; then perform smoke tests to verify functionality. Typically automated in CI/CD, the business value is accelerating release cycles, reducing operational risks, and ensuring efficient resource utilization.
