Cloud-native data management solutions integrate containerization and Kubernetes technologies to automate data storage and processing workflows, supporting elastic scalability. Data privacy is crucial as it involves users' sensitive information, requiring compliance assurance (such as GDPR or HIPAA). These solutions are applied in the financial or healthcare industries to protect personal data and maintain business trust.

Core mechanisms include end-to-end encryption (e.g., TLS for encrypted transmission and AES for storage encryption), role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access, data desensitization (e.g., masking sensitive fields), and security compliance frameworks (integrating Kubernetes Secrets or Vault tools). In practice, this is achieved through cloud-native platforms to implement unified data governance, ensuring transmission and storage security, reducing the risk of non-compliance, and affecting auditability and trust in digital transformation.

Implementation steps: formulate privacy policies, deploy encryption tools, configure fine-grained access rules, add audit logs, and conduct regular compliance checks. Typical scenarios include processing customer data in microservice architectures to reduce leakage risks. Business values include reducing fines, enhancing user trust, and meeting regulatory requirements.
