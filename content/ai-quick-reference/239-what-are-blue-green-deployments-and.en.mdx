Blue-green deployment is a zero-downtime software release strategy that uses two independent environments (blue for the current production version and green for the newly deployed version). Its importance lies in achieving seamless upgrades and rollbacks, reducing deployment risks, and its application scenarios include cloud-native services, e-commerce, and other high-availability systems.

Its core components include dynamic traffic switching by load balancers, parallel maintenance of dual environments, and health check mechanisms, with features of instant traffic transfer and version isolation. The principle is to complete environment switching through routing changes. In practical applications, it reduces production interruptions, improves continuous delivery efficiency, and is widely used in containerization management such as Kubernetes.

Automation steps are implemented through CI/CD tools: 1. Automatically deploy the new version to the green environment; 2. Run automated tests for verification; 3. After passing the health check, automatically switch the load balancer traffic to the green environment. A typical scenario is the DevOps pipeline, and its business values include accelerating the release cycle, reducing human errors, and enhancing system reliability.
