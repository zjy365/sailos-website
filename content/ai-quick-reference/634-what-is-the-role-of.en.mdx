A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed system that accelerates content delivery through globally deployed edge servers, significantly reducing latency and improving user access speed. It is crucial in data management, especially in high-traffic scenarios such as streaming media, e-commerce websites, or big data distribution, ensuring global accessibility and high availability of content.

The core of a CDN includes edge node caching mechanisms, load balancers, and intelligent routing protocols. The caching mechanism stores popular static or dynamic data on nodes close to users, reducing the pressure on origin servers; dynamic content acceleration technologies such as SSL optimization enhance data security. This architecture optimizes resource utilization when managing data, for example, for distributing videos, images, or API data, thereby reducing bandwidth costs, enhancing scalability, and achieving efficient load sharing.

In data management, CDNs are used for efficient data transmission and synchronization, ensuring data reliability and consistency. Their value lies in improving user experience, optimizing data access performance, reducing management overhead, and supporting business agility.
