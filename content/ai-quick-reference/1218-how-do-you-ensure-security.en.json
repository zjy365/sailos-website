  "content": "CI/CD pipeline security refers to preventing security threats during the automated integration and deployment process, reducing vulnerability risks by protecting code, data, and infrastructure. It is crucial in cloud-native applications and DevOps workflows, ensuring that rapid iterative software delivery does not compromise security, such as avoiding data breaches or service disruptions in sensitive data environments.\n\nCore components include static code scanning (SAST), dynamic scanning (DAST), secure secret management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), and container image scanning (e.g., Trivy). Features like least privilege access control and end-to-end encryption ensure the security of all pipeline stages (build, test, deployment), enhance compliance, reduce the attack surface, and significantly lower operational risks.\n\nImplementation steps: Integrate automated security tools into CI/CD workflows; strictly manage secrets using key vaults; restrict user permissions (e.g., RBAC); conduct regular audits and vulnerability scans (e.g., via Kubernetes policies). Typical scenarios such as containerized deployments on cloud platforms can accelerate secure releases, reduce the cost of security incidents, and enhance business trust."
