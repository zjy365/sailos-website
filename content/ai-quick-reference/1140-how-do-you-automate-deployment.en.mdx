Implementing deployment automation in a hybrid cloud environment refers to using a toolchain to coordinate and manage private and public cloud resources, and automatically completing application building, testing, configuration, and release through standardized processes to eliminate manual intervention. This is crucial for improving the consistency, efficiency, and reliability of cross-environment deployments, especially suitable for business scenarios that need to balance data sovereignty, flexible scalability, or disaster recovery requirements.

The core lies in unified orchestration and abstraction: First, use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools (such as Terraform, Pulumi) to define and configure all cloud resources in code. Second, establish CI/CD pipelines (such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions), integrate version control (Git), and automate code building and testing (unit, integration). Finally, adopt deployment orchestrators (such as Argo CD, Flux) to implement the GitOps paradigm, ensuring that the desired state declared through the Git repository can be automatically synchronized to the hybrid cluster (including Kubernetes). Key components also include Kubernetes (as the standard deployment layer for containerized applications), cloud service provider API integration, and unified configuration management tools. An abstraction layer must be designed to shield the detailed differences of different cloud environments.

The implementation steps mainly include: 1. Use IaC tools to declaratively define hybrid cloud infrastructure and network topology. 2. Build application container images in the CI pipeline and push them to the shared image repository. 3. Use Helm/Kustomize to define application deployment manifests and store them in the Git repository. 4. Configure CD tools (such as Argo CD) to monitor the Git repository and automatically synchronize and deploy application manifests to the target hybrid cloud environment (including K8s clusters or specific cloud services). This significantly shortens the release cycle, reduces the risk of configuration drift, and improves compliance.
