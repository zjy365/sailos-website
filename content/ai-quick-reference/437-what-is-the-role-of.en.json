  "content": "Microservices architecture is a design pattern that decomposes an application into small, independent services, each running in its own process and communicating via APIs. It is crucial in CI/CD pipelines as it supports agile development and rapid iteration in cloud-native environments, allowing teams to update services independently, making it suitable for high scalability requirements such as e-commerce or streaming platforms.\n\nCore components include service autonomy and loose coupling, where each microservice can have its own dedicated build, test, and deployment processes. This independence enables parallel CI/CD pipelines, reduces dependency risks, enhances fault isolation capabilities, significantly accelerates feedback loops, impacts DevOps practices, and promotes higher deployment frequency and system resilience.\n\nIn CI/CD, the application of microservices architecture is reflected in efficient automated testing, rolling deployments, and on-demand scaling. Its value lies in significantly increasing release speed, reducing error rates, optimizing resource utilization, and helping businesses achieve faster time-to-market and competitive advantages."
