Cloud-native development environment refers to a technical system that utilizes cloud services (such as containers, Kubernetes, and microservices) to build scalable and elastic applications. Its importance lies in supporting rapid iteration, high availability, and resource optimization, making it suitable for scenarios like internet services, AI, and big data.

Core languages need to be lightweight, support high concurrency, and be compatible with cloud ecosystems: Go has become the preferred choice for Kubernetes and microservices due to its efficient concurrency model and low memory footprint; Java/Python are widely used in enterprise-level applications and AI with their rich frameworks (e.g., Spring Boot/Django); Node.js is suitable for real-time APIs with its non-blocking I/O; Rust/Kotlin are emerging in security-critical systems and Android cloud integration. These languages improve resource utilization through containerized deployment and drive DevOps automation.

Selection requires balancing ecosystem, team skills, and scenario needs: Go is suitable for high-performance backends, Java/Python facilitate rapid development, and Node.js optimizes I/O-intensive tasks. It is recommended to integrate CI/CD toolchains (e.g., Jenkins/Argo CD) to achieve continuous deployment and fault self-healing, ultimately reducing operational costs and accelerating business innovation.
