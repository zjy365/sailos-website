  "content": "Cloud-native applications are built on microservices, containers, and dynamic orchestration, with APIs serving as their core communication interfaces. Ensuring secure API access is crucial, as it prevents unauthorized access, data leaks, and attacks. Application scenarios include multi-tenant cloud environments and cross-service interactions, enhancing overall system reliability.\n\nCore components include authentication (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), authorization (based on RBAC or ABAC), encryption (TLS for transmission), and API gateways or service meshes (e.g., Istio). The zero-trust principle and network policy isolation features strengthen security between microservices. Practical impacts include enhanced data privacy, compliance with regulations like GDPR, and promotion of DevSecOps practices.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy an API gateway to manage incoming traffic; 2. Integrate an identity provider for authentication; 3. Configure fine-grained authorization policies; 4. Apply TLS encryption; 5. Enable monitoring and log auditing. Typical scenarios include access between services in Kubernetes clusters. Business values lie in reducing security risks, improving scalability, and accelerating secure deployment cycles."
