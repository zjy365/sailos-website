  "content": "Multi-cloud deployment refers to enterprises using multiple public cloud providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) to host applications or services, aiming to avoid vendor lock-in, enhance reliability, and optimize costs. Its importance lies in improving business continuity and flexibility, applicable to high-availability systems, disaster recovery, and geographically distributed scenarios.\n\nThe core components include cross-cloud management tools (such as Kubernetes multi-cluster), with features involving portability, redundancy mechanisms, and automatic load balancing. The principle is to achieve application consistency through containerization and service mesh. In practical applications, it supports compliance with data residency requirements (such as GDPR) and improves performance by deploying resources nearby, promoting the popularization of cloud-native architecture.\n\nApplication values include reducing downtime risks, dynamically adjusting resources to save costs, and strengthening business resilience. Typical use cases include data backup in the financial industry or elastic scaling of global services, bringing higher innovation potential and market adaptability."
