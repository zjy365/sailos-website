Cloud-native applications run in cloud environments and often involve sensitive data stored in containerized components. Data privacy protection is crucial to ensure that user information is not leaked and to comply with regulations such as GDPR, applicable to industries requiring high security like e-commerce and healthcare.

Core processing methods include: using Kubernetes Secrets to encrypt and store credential data, restricting user permissions through RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and integrating data encryption (in transit and at rest). The principle lies in the least privilege principle; tools like service meshes (Istio) provide end-to-end encryption, reducing leakage risks in practical applications and supporting multi-cloud compliance architectures.

Implementation steps: 1. Manage sensitive data using Secrets to avoid plaintext storage. 2. Configure RBAC policies to strictly limit access scope. 3. Enable TLS or disk encryption, combined with audit log monitoring. Typical scenarios include encryption of containerized databases. Business values include enhanced data protection, avoidance of fines, strengthened customer trust, and promotion of compliant business growth.
