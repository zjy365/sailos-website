  "content": "Microservices is an architectural style that decomposes a monolithic application into independently deployable small services. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) enables communication between services through asynchronous events, eliminating direct dependencies. Its importance lies in enhancing system scalability, resilience, and loose coupling, making it suitable for high-concurrency and real-time scenarios such as e-commerce order processing or inventory updates.\n\nThe core components of EDA include event producers (which generate events like order creation), event consumers (which respond to events like inventory deduction), and event streaming platforms such as Kafka or RabbitMQ responsible for message delivery. The principle is based on the publish-subscribe model, and event persistence ensures reliable delivery. In practical applications, microservices implementing EDA support independent deployment and evolution of services, such as transaction events triggering risk control processing in financial services, significantly reducing the risk of system failures.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Identify business events (e.g., payment success). 2. Deploy event streaming infrastructure (such as a Kafka cluster). 3. Build producer microservices (to generate events) and consumer microservices (for processing logic). 4. Integrate error handling such as retry mechanisms. Typical scenarios include real-time response to user behavior analysis. Business values include supporting agile iteration, reducing costs, and improving system resilience."
