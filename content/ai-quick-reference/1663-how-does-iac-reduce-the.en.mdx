Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of defining and managing infrastructure, such as servers or network settings, through code, ensuring configuration consistency and repeatability. Its importance lies in eliminating manual errors, improving efficiency, and it is suitable for cloud computing environments and DevOps processes, such as the automatic deployment of Kubernetes clusters.

The core of IaC includes declarative configuration files (e.g., Terraform), version control tools, and automation engines, enabling idempotency and auditability of resources. The principle is to define the state based on scripts, with tools executing changes. In practical applications, it simplifies the creation, update, and destruction of infrastructure, significantly reducing error handling time and accelerating resource iteration.

Implementing IaC can reduce time by: 1) Writing infrastructure code templates; 2) Integrating automation tools (e.g., Ansible) to execute deployments; 3) Combining CI/CD pipelines for automatic verification. The business value is shortening the deployment cycle to minutes, with typical scenarios including cloud migration or microservice releases, improving reliability and resource utilization.
