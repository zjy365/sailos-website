Cloud-native applications refer to software specifically designed for cloud environments, emphasizing scalability, elasticity, and agile delivery. Their importance lies in optimizing resource utilization, supporting distributed architectures, and adapting to rapid iteration needs, with wide applications in scenarios such as microservices, containerized deployment, and serverless computing.

The main challenges in developing cloud-native applications include organizational cultural transformation (such as implementing DevOps collaboration), technical complexity (involving Kubernetes orchestration and service mesh management), security (such as the implementation of zero-trust models), and observability (requiring real-time logging and monitoring). These core characteristics stem from cloud-native principles, such as decoupled services, which actually impact development efficiency, system reliability, and drive the evolution of cloud-native ecosystem tools.

The application value of these challenges lies in guiding teams to identify risk points. For example, adopting infrastructure as code and automated deployment can significantly enhance business agility, reduce costs, strengthen application resilience, and accelerate the digital transformation process.
