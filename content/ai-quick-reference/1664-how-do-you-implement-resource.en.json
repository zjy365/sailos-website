  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure resource management through scripts. Resource tagging and organization enable resource identification, cost tracking, and security governance, thereby enhancing operational efficiency in multi-team cloud environments.\n\nCore components include tagging strategies (such as key-value pairs like env:prod, app:web) and resource grouping mechanisms (such as modular scripts). In practical applications, tags support automated operations (e.g., backup scheduling) and improve resource auditability and maintainability.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define unified tagging specifications; 2. Embed tag attributes in IaC tools (e.g., Terraform); 3. Organize resources using modules. A typical scenario is environment isolation, with business values including cost optimization and reduced compliance risks."
