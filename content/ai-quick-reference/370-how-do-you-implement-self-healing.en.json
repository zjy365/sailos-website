  "content": "A self-healing system is a mechanism that automatically detects and repairs faults. Implementing it in the deployment pipeline can significantly enhance system resilience, reduce downtime, and ensure the stability and reliability of continuous deployment. Key application scenarios include CI/CD pipeline automation to handle deployment failures or runtime errors, thereby supporting the operation and maintenance of cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes.\n\nThe core components include a monitoring module (e.g., Prometheus for real-time metrics collection), health checks (e.g., Kubernetes liveness probes to detect container health status), and automatic response mechanisms (e.g., restarting services or performing rollbacks). The principle is based on predefined rule-triggered automatic repair processes, reducing manual intervention. In practical applications, it enhances pipeline efficiency, such as achieving zero-touch recovery through GitOps tools, with impacts including shortening MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) and optimizing resource utilization.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Integrate monitoring tools and configure alert rules. 2. Set health checks and automatic rollback policies in deployment manifests. 3. Define repair actions such as node restart or version rollback. A typical scenario is automatic recovery when Kubernetes rolling updates fail. Business values include reducing operational costs, improving availability, and ensuring user experience."
