In a hybrid cloud environment, containerization uses containers (such as Docker) to package applications and their dependencies, enabling consistent deployment, portability, and elastic scaling across private and public clouds. Its importance lies in unified resource management, cost optimization, and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities. Application scenarios include microservices architecture deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and dynamic resource allocation.

Core components include container runtimes (such as Docker) and orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes), characterized by lightweight isolation and environmental consistency. In practical applications, Kubernetes clusters are used to manage hybrid cloud nodes, configure network interconnection and storage synchronization, support automatic scaling and multi-cluster governance, improve application high availability and operational efficiency, and accelerate cloud-native transformation.

Implementation steps: 1. Containerize applications and deploy Kubernetes clusters. 2. Configure hybrid cloud network policies to achieve intercommunication. 3. Automate CI/CD tools to manage rolling deployments. Typical scenarios include public clouds handling high traffic and private clouds running compliant applications. Business values include improving agility, reducing vendor lock-in, and optimizing resource utilization.
