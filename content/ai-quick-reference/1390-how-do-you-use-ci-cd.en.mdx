CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) enables fast and reliable application delivery by automating software building, testing, and deployment processes. It is crucial in DevOps and cloud-native environments to reduce deployment time, increase release frequency, and is suitable for microservices architecture and cloud application development.

The core components include code repositories, automated build tools (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions), test suites, deployment pipelines, and monitoring mechanisms. Its features are high automation, fast feedback loops, and continuous integration. In practical applications, it integrates Kubernetes deployment strategies (such as rolling updates), significantly reducing environment setup time and error rates. The impacts include improved deployment reliability and team efficiency.

Implementation steps: First, configure the CI server to automate the process from code submission to building and testing; second, define the CD pipeline to automatically deploy to the target environment (such as a production cluster) and perform verification; finally, integrate monitoring tools to optimize performance. Typical scenarios include automatic triggering based on Git events, and the business value is reflected in accelerating the release cycle, reducing downtime, and improving market response speed.
