  "content": "Microservices is an architectural style that splits applications into independent small services. Handling diverse request types such as HTTP, RPC, and events in distributed systems is crucial, which improves scalability and fault isolation, and is widely used in high-concurrency scenarios like e-commerce payments.\n\nCore mechanisms include API gateways responsible for request routing and aggregation, service discovery enabling dynamic addressing, and asynchronous message queues (such as Kafka) processing event-driven requests. These features ensure high availability and loose coupling, support independent deployment and evolution of services, and significantly enhance system resilience and development efficiency.\n\nDuring implementation, synchronous requests are processed through API gateways; asynchronous events are managed using message middleware; specific steps include service registration to a center (such as Consul), defining RESTful interfaces, and configuring load balancers. A typical scenario is the order processing system. By decoupling request types, the business value is reflected in accelerating iteration, reducing dependencies, and improving resource utilization."
