Proactive monitoring and alerting are core to cloud-native operations, aiming to predict and prevent issues rather than respond passively. Their importance lies in ensuring the stability and high availability of complex, dynamic microservice architectures, directly supporting business continuity, and applying to critical scenarios such as online transactions and real-time stream processing.

The core lies in full-stack observability (metrics, logs, traces), dynamic target discovery, and intelligent alert management. It is necessary to deploy Prometheus as a time-series database to scrape container/K8s metrics; use Loki to collect distributed logs; and leverage Jaeger or OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. Alerts are aggregated, deduplicated, and routed through Alertmanager, integrated with notification channels like Slack and PagerDuty. Automatic service discovery adapts to dynamic Pod scaling, and SLOs (Service Level Objectives) define business health standards.

Implementation steps:

1. Deploy monitoring agents: Deploy the `Prometheus Operator` in the Kubernetes cluster to automatically manage scraping tasks, and integrate applications with the OpenTelemetry SDK to output metrics/traces.

2. Configure log pipelines: Use `FluentBit` to collect container logs and transfer them to `Loki`.

3. Define alert rules: Write `Alert Rules` in Prometheus based on key metrics (e.g., P99 request latency, error rate).

4. Set up alert routing: Configure `Alertmanager` grouping policies (e.g., by environment/service) and notification channel silence rules.

5. Establish SLO alerts: Use tools like `Sloth` to convert SLOs into Burn Rate alerts for early warning.

Business value: Reduce MTTR by up to 50% and improve capacity planning efficiency by 30%.
