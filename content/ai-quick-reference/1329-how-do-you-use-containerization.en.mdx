Containerization is a technology that packages applications and their dependencies into independent, lightweight units for execution. Its core advantage lies in providing environmental consistency, eliminating the ""it works on my machine"" problem, and is crucial in CI/CD pipelines as it accelerates the automation of code building, testing, and deployment, enhancing iteration speed and reliability.

Core components include container engines (such as Docker), container images, and orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes). The principle is based on isolation and shared OS kernels, ensuring each build phase executes in the same environment. In practical applications, containerization reduces environment configuration time by isolating build and test tasks, avoids version conflicts, and improves the scalability and repeatability of CI/CD pipelines.

Implementation steps: First, containerize the application: create a Dockerfile to define the image. Second, integrate CI/CD tools: call containers to run tasks in scripts, such as using containers for compilation and testing in Jenkins or GitLab. Typical scenarios include using containers to manage deployments and ensure production environment consistency. The business value is reducing build time by 50% and accelerating new feature delivery.
