  "content": "Edge storage refers to deploying storage capabilities on edge devices or nodes close to data sources to reduce data processing latency. Its importance lies in improving the performance of cloud-native data management, supporting real-time applications such as industrial Internet of Things and smart cities, and ensuring data availability in low-bandwidth environments.\n\nCore features include a distributed architecture that supports fast data access and local caching. In practical applications, it integrates Kubernetes persistent volumes, enabling edge nodes to process data independently, enhancing the resilience, scalability, and data governance efficiency of cloud-native systems, and reducing central cloud load.\n\nMain applications and values: By localizing data storage and processing at the edge, it accelerates response and saves bandwidth costs; the values include improving business agility, supporting real-time decision-making, optimizing user experience, and strengthening the overall data-driven capabilities of cloud-native environments."
