Kubernetes uses Role-Based Access Control as the core mechanism for managing access to cloud-native resources. It is crucial in multi-tenant and team collaboration environments to ensure that users and service accounts can only access the resources they need, meeting security compliance requirements.

The core components of RBAC include: `Role` (a set of permission rules within a namespace) and `ClusterRole` (a set of permission rules across the cluster); `RoleBinding` (granting Role permissions to users/service accounts within a single namespace) and `ClusterRoleBinding` (granting ClusterRole permissions across the entire cluster). Service accounts are identity credentials for Pods and applications. Admission controllers and audit logs should be combined to enhance the security and traceability of access control.

Specific implementation steps: First, configure authentication (supporting static tokens, certificates, or integration with OIDC/LDAP). Second, design permission policies: use the `kubectl create role/rolebinding` command or declarative resource files to create the required Roles/RoleBindings, strictly following the principle of least privilege to grant API operation permissions. Bind permissions to users, groups, or service accounts. Finally, continuously test and audit permission configurations using `kubectl auth can-i` or by simulating application runs to ensure security and meet audit standards.
