Automation refers to reducing manual operations through tools and scripts, and optimizing the configuration and management processes of cloud resources. It is crucial in cloud infrastructure management as it improves efficiency, reduces human errors, and supports application scenarios such as dynamic scaling, real-time monitoring, and disaster recovery, ensuring system reliability and agile response to business needs.

Its core components include Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform, orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes, and API integration. It is characterized by consistent deployment, self-healing, and elastic scaling, with the principle based on a declarative model to automate resource lifecycle management. In practical applications, it supports the rapid iteration of cloud-native architectures, such as implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in DevOps, enhancing scalability, reducing costs, and promoting unified operations in multi-cloud environments.

The role of automation includes optimizing resource utilization, reducing operational expenses, improving service availability, and ensuring security compliance such as automatic patch management. By enabling seamless scaling and rapid response to changes, it brings business value to enterprises, including accelerated innovation, risk mitigation, and agile business transformation.
