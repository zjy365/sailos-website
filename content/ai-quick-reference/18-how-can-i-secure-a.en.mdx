Cloud-native development environments are development and testing environments built using cloud infrastructure and containerization technologies. Securing them is crucial to prevent data breaches, attacks, and configuration errors, and they are widely used in agile software development within continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

Its core components include secure container image management, network isolation, role-based access control, and secrets management. Features such as the implementation of DevSecOps principles enable shifting security left, enhancing protection through tools like image scanners and Kubernetes policies, improving development efficiency and reducing vulnerability risks, which affects the reliability and compliance of the cloud-native ecosystem.

Implementation steps: prefer trusted base images; apply the principle of least privilege; integrate automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines; deploy continuous monitoring and auditing mechanisms. Typical scenarios include automatic vulnerability remediation during the development phase, with business values of accelerating secure application delivery, reducing operational costs, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
