IaC workflows automatically manage infrastructure through code, enhancing consistency and security. Their importance includes reducing human errors and accelerating deployments, with application scenarios such as cloud environment DevOps processes and Kubernetes cluster maintenance, enabling rapid response to threats.

Core components include IaC code repositories (e.g., Terraform), CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitLab CI), and security scanning tools (e.g., Snyk). The principle is version control integration to automatically detect vulnerabilities and update resource configurations. Practical application: adding scans in the pipeline, enforcing patch application, ensuring compliance, reducing risks, and significantly improving the resilience of cloud-native systems.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate vulnerability scanners in the CI phase; 2. Automatically test patches in a sandbox environment; 3. Trigger deployment updates to production. Business values include enhanced security compliance and reduced downtime, with typical scenarios such as automatically updating container images or cloud resources, driving cost-effectiveness.
