  "content": "Cloud-native development builds scalable, elastic, and agile application systems through technologies such as containers and microservices. Its importance lies in improving resource utilization, accelerating iteration speed, and enhancing system resilience, and it is widely used in scenarios with high concurrency and rapid response requirements such as the Internet and finance.\n\nCore practices include: 1) Microservice architecture decouples functions to support independent deployment and scaling; 2) Containerization (e.g., Docker) ensures environmental consistency; 3) Kubernetes enables orchestration automation and self-healing; 4) CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment; 5) Declarative configuration (e.g., IaC) manages infrastructure. In addition, combining observability tools (logs, metrics, distributed tracing) and DevOps culture improves collaboration efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: First, decouple the application into microservices and encapsulate them in containers; second, use Kubernetes for orchestration and cluster management; then establish a GitOps process to automate deployment through code repositories; finally, integrate monitoring, alerting, and log analysis. This process significantly shortens the release cycle, reduces operational costs, and improves business continuity."
