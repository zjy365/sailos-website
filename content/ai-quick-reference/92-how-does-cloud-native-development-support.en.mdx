Cloud-native development supports large-scale application deployment through containerization, microservice architecture, and dynamic orchestration. Its core lies in leveraging the elasticity and automation capabilities of cloud computing to significantly improve deployment efficiency, resource utilization, and system resilience, making it suitable for high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce platforms or Internet of Things systems.

Its core components include container technology (e.g., Docker for packaging applications), Kubernetes orchestration (for automatically scheduling container clusters), and microservice decomposition (for decoupling functions). Features include declarative APIs, service meshes, and CI/CD automation. In practical applications, zero-downtime deployment is achieved through rolling updates, and traffic peaks are handled through horizontal scaling, significantly reducing operational complexity and enhancing fault isolation capabilities.

Implementation steps include: containerizing application packaging → deploying to Kubernetes clusters → configuring auto-scaling policies (HPA) → integrating monitoring (Prometheus) and logging (ELK). Typical business values are reflected in high availability (99.95%+ SLA), resource cost optimization (on-demand scaling), and rapid iteration capabilities, supporting millions of concurrent scenarios.
