Cross-cloud data management involves coordinating the storage, access, and consistency of data across multiple cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), ensuring security, mobility, and elasticity. In cloud-native environments, its importance lies in supporting business agility, reducing the risk of vendor lock-in, and being applied in hybrid cloud deployments, disaster recovery, and data-driven microservice architectures to optimize costs and resilience.

Core components include: distributed storage abstractions (e.g., CSI drivers), data synchronization mechanisms (e.g., asynchronous replication), API gateways, and policy-based encryption. Features include automation, elasticity, and observability, with tools like Velero or Rook enabling cross-cloud data migration and backup. In practical applications, this supports global data access, with impacts including improved system reliability, accelerated innovation, and avoidance of single points of failure.

Processing steps are: 1. Adopt a unified interface (e.g., S3-compatible storage) to abstract cloud differences; 2. Deploy data replication tools (e.g., Velero) for synchronization; 3. Integrate Kubernetes orchestration to manage policies. A typical scenario is a hybrid cloud data lake, with business values including reduced migration costs, enhanced compliance, and support for real-time analytics.
