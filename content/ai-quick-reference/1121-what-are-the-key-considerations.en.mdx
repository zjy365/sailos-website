A multi-cloud strategy involves using multiple cloud service providers to enhance resilience, avoid vendor lock-in, and optimize costs. Key considerations are crucial to ensure a balance between benefits and complexity, and it is widely applied in enterprise digital transformation and global business continuity scenarios.

Core components include cost management and optimization, business continuity and disaster recovery, compliance and security, as well as interoperability and portability. These factors ensure efficiency in cross-cloud environments, such as saving expenses through dynamic pricing optimization, improving availability through multi-region deployment, and meeting different regulatory requirements.

These considerations strengthen business resilience, such as reducing downtime risks and facilitating innovative experiments. The practical value includes enhancing overall performance to drive cost efficiency while accelerating the ability to respond to market changes.
