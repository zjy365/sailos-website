  "content": "Microservices architecture is a software development approach that decomposes a single application into multiple independent, loosely coupled, and independently deployable small services. It is crucial for enabling agile workflows as it supports autonomous development by small teams, frequent releases, and rapid response to changes, perfectly aligning with the iterative and incremental delivery principles of agility.\n\nMicroservices architecture supports agility by splitting the system into services built around business domains (Domain-Driven Design). Its core characteristics include independent service deployment (automated using containerization/K8s), lightweight communication (e.g., API/REST), diversity of technology stacks, and decentralized data management. Each service is fully owned by a small cross-functional team (team autonomy), which significantly reduces cross-team coordination costs, allows parallel development and independent technical decision-making, thereby accelerating iteration speed and innovation capability.\n\nSpecific steps to implement microservices in support of agility include: splitting the monolithic application into independent services by business domain; establishing independent CI/CD pipelines for each service to enable automated building, testing, and deployment (utilizing K8s and cloud infrastructure); empowering teams with end-to-end service ownership; and enhancing inter-service API contract management and aggregated monitoring logs. This delivers significant business value: extremely fast feature delivery speed, higher system resilience and reliability (fault isolation), independent scalability, and stronger technical adaptability and innovation capability."
