Service proxy is an intermediate layer component used to coordinate communication between services in a microservices architecture, acting as a request router and processor. Its importance lies in improving communication reliability, security, and scalability, and it is suitable for scenarios such as service discovery, load balancing, and security control to ensure efficient interaction in distributed systems.

The core functions of a service proxy include dynamic routing, traffic management, circuit breaking mechanisms, and authentication and authorization. Based on the reverse proxy principle, it intercepts and processes requests to achieve elastic isolation and monitoring logs. In practical applications, the proxy simplifies microservice decoupling, provides centralized governance, promotes fault recovery and continuous deployment, and significantly enhances system resilience and management efficiency.

Its core role is to abstract communication complexity, provide a unified entry point, and support flexible policy execution. The resulting value includes enhanced security (such as API protection), optimized performance (reduced latency), support for dynamic scaling, and improved overall system observability and business continuity.
