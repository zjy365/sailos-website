Hybrid cloud infrastructure refers to an environment that combines public and private clouds. Performance monitoring ensures efficient and secure system operation by tracking resource utilization, latency, and availability, and is crucial for business continuity, cost optimization, and compliance. It is suitable for cross-cloud deployment scenarios such as finance and e-commerce.

Core methods include adopting unified monitoring platforms (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana), integrating APIs and agents to collect multi-source data, supporting real-time metric analysis, automatic alerting, and root cause diagnosis. Features encompass scalability, automatic repair mechanisms, and AI prediction. Practical applications improve fault response speed by over 50%, optimize load balancing and cloud spending, and impact IT operation efficiency and risk management.

Implementation steps: 1. Select compatible tool sets (e.g., integrating AWS CloudWatch with on-premises Kubernetes); 2. Deploy lightweight agents to all nodes; 3. Configure critical threshold alerts; 4. Automate analysis and optimization strategies. Typical scenarios include containerized application monitoring; business value lies in reducing downtime by 30%, cutting annual costs by 20%, and enhancing hybrid cloud elasticity.
