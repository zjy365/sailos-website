Dependency management in CI/CD pipelines ensures the accuracy and consistency of software component versions, avoids conflicts, and enhances the reliability of builds and deployments. It is crucial in cloud-native environments, applicable to microservices development and Kubernetes deployment scenarios, supporting efficient automated processes.

The core components include package managers (such as npm or Maven), dependency lock files (such as package-lock.json), and caching mechanisms. Its features include automated resolution and verification of dependency versions; the principle is integrating CI tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automatically handle dependencies. In practical applications, containerization technologies (such as Docker) store dependencies in images, ensuring the portability and security of Kubernetes clusters, significantly reducing deployment errors and accelerating iterations.

Implementation steps: First, configure dependency installation commands (e.g., npm install) in the CI script, second, enable caching to optimize build time, and then perform dependency locking and vulnerability scanning. A typical scenario is microservices CI/CD, with business values including reducing failure rates, shortening release cycles, and improving team efficiency.
