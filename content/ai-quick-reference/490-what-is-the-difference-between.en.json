  "content": "Microservices is an application architectural style that splits a system into small, independent service units, each running in a separate process and communicating via network APIs; serverless architecture, on the other hand, is a cloud computing model where developers do not need to manage the underlying infrastructure, and functions are automatically executed based on event triggers. Both are important in modern distributed systems: microservices enhance maintainability, agility, and scalability, and are applied in complex businesses such as e-commerce platforms; serverless simplifies operations and maintenance, enables pay-as-you-go billing, and is suitable for event processing scenarios like API gateways or real-time data processing.\n\nThe core characteristics of microservices include service autonomy, bounded context, and independent deployment, typically achieved through container technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes for isolation and management; in practical applications, they support high-concurrency systems such as Netflix's video streaming service, enhancing modularity and continuous delivery. The core of serverless architecture is Function as a Service (FaaS), automatic scaling, and platform-managed resources; its application significantly reduces operational burden, processes background tasks through services like AWS Lambda, improves development efficiency, and reduces costs.\n\nThe key difference is that microservices focus on the layered structure of applications and control over the runtime environment, requiring active infrastructure management; while serverless focuses on resource abstraction and event-driven execution, with no need for operational intervention. The value of this distinction lies in optimizing technology selection: microservices provide architectural flexibility for building core businesses, while serverless is suitable for elastic, short-duration tasks to reduce costs; the two can be used in combination, such as building the main framework with microservices and handling asynchronous logic with serverless, to achieve cloud-native benefits."
