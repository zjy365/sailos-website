An IAM Role is an identity entity in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) used to temporarily authorize access to AWS resources. It is crucial in cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes or AWS EKS, ensuring the principle of least privilege and preventing unauthorized access. Application scenarios include containerized applications securely accessing S3 buckets or RDS databases, enhancing resource isolation and compliance.

The core components include permission policies (defining allowed actions and resources), trust policies (specifying who can assume the role, such as ECS tasks or EKS pods), and temporary security credentials. Features are dynamicity (avoiding permanent keys) and delegability (resource proxy access). Practical applications involve integration in cloud-native deployments, for example, Kubernetes pods associating roles through service accounts to securely call AWS APIs, reducing the risk of credential leakage.

Implementation steps: First, create an IAM role and define permission policies; second, set up trust policies to allow services (such as ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com) to assume the role; finally, use the role ARN in resources (such as pod specifications). This ensures zero-trust security, simplifies operations and maintenance, and improves efficiency; typical business values include reducing data breach costs and supporting continuous delivery.
