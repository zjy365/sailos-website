  "content": "In cloud-native environments, data governance strategies ensure data quality, security, and compliance, which are particularly crucial in distributed microservices architectures. Application scenarios include AI, real-time analytics, and cross-service data sharing, supporting agile business decision-making.\n\nCore components include metadata management, access control, data catalogs, and policy-as-code. End-to-end governance is implemented through tools such as service meshes and DataHub to address the complexity of distributed data, enhance reliability, and reduce compliance risks, impacting business continuity and data trust.\n\nImplementation steps: Define a data governance framework; deploy tools like Kubernetes policy engines; automate quality checks in CI/CD pipelines; and conduct continuous monitoring and auditing. Business value: Ensure compliance (e.g., GDPR), enhance data credibility, accelerate innovation, and optimize costs."
