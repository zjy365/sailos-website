  "content": "Cloud-native development environments are based on containerization and microservices, supporting agile and scalable application deployment. Security is crucial to prevent data breaches and system attacks, and they are applied in DevOps pipelines and cloud services.\n\nThe core includes hardening container images (such as vulnerability scanning), protecting microservice APIs (such as authentication), and infrastructure-as-code security (such as Kubernetes policies). Practical applications like automated auditing and the principle of least privilege significantly reduce risks and improve compliance.\n\nFollow these steps: use trusted image sources; implement a zero-trust network; monitor runtime anomalies; encrypt secret management; regularly update patches. The business value is reducing security incidents, enhancing resilience, and optimizing operational costs."
