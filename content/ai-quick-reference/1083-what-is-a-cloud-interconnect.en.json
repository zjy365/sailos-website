  "content": "Cloud interconnection is a network service that enables on-premises data centers, enterprise branches, hosting facilities, or resources from different cloud providers to reliably access one or more public cloud environments by establishing dedicated, secure, and high-performance connections (typically using dedicated physical lines or encrypted VPN tunnels).\n\nAt its core is the establishment of dedicated physical (such as leased lines) or virtual (such as IPsec VPN) connection channels. Data is transmitted through this channel in an encrypted state, avoiding exposure to the public Internet. Users can control routing policies and IP address planning to achieve seamless integration between the local network and the cloud virtual private cloud, providing high bandwidth, low latency, and consistent network performance, while avoiding the latency, jitter, and security risks of traditional Internet transmission.\n\nIn hybrid clouds, cloud interconnection enables secure and high-speed mutual access between on-premises IT resources and public cloud resources. Key roles include: integrating resources for unified management, supporting smooth application migration and expansion, building cross-cloud disaster recovery solutions, and meeting data sovereignty and security compliance requirements. Its value lies in significantly improving the reliability, performance, and security of hybrid cloud networks and simplifying network topology."
