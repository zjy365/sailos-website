In a microservices architecture, service monitoring and logging are core practices to ensure system reliability and observability. Their importance includes real-time fault detection and performance optimization, with application scenarios covering distributed transaction tracing and operational diagnostics.

The core of service monitoring involves collecting metrics (such as latency and error rates), distributed tracing, and health checks; logging requires standardized formats and centralization. Common tools like Prometheus and ELK Stack improve fault location speed, with impacts including supporting DevOps collaboration and reducing downtime risks.

Processing steps: First, integrate monitoring agents into each service; second, deploy a log aggregation system (e.g., Fluentd); third, configure alerting mechanisms. A typical scenario is implementing automation through Kubernetes Operator, with business value in enhancing system stability and accelerating recovery.
