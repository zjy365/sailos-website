In cloud-native environments, CI/CD tools are key automation components that enable continuous integration and continuous delivery, automating code building, testing, and deployment. They adapt to dynamic cloud architectures such as Kubernetes and containerization, enhance software delivery speed and reliability, and are applied in microservice deployment and DevOps workflows to ensure rapid iteration and high-quality releases.

Commonly used tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Spinnaker, and native tools like Tekton. These tools support containerized builds and Kubernetes integration, and implement flexible workflows through declarative pipelines. Practical applications include auto-scaling and cross-environment deployment, which improve team collaboration and efficiency, significantly reduce human errors, and enhance system observability and resilience.

These tools are used to accelerate build pipelines and seamlessly deploy to cloud platforms such as AWS or GCP. Their value includes shortening release cycles, improving business agility, reducing operational costs, supporting highly available microservice architectures, and empowering enterprises with innovation and competitive advantages.
