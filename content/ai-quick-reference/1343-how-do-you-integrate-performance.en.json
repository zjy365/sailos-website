  "content": "Performance testing is a key practice for evaluating an application's responsiveness and stability under load, ensuring the reliability of production systems and user experience. Its importance lies in identifying bottlenecks in advance to prevent performance degradation. Integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, it enables automated validation of each change, with application scenarios including secure deployment in continuous delivery processes.\n\nThe core components include load generation tools (such as JMeter or K6), test scripts, and environment simulation. Features involve automated execution, monitoring of key metrics (such as response time), and baseline setting. In practical applications, it runs during the build or deployment phase to detect performance regressions, optimize resource allocation, and have a positive impact on system reliability and rapid iteration.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Integrate the performance testing framework into CI tools like Jenkins; 2. Add automated tasks to the CD pipeline; 3. Define performance benchmarks and thresholds; 4. Generate reports and set up alerts; 5. Execute tests in an isolated environment. Business values include reducing the risk of production incidents, improving deployment quality, and enhancing user satisfaction."
