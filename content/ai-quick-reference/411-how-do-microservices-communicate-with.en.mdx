Microservice communication is the mechanism for data exchange between services, ensuring independent collaboration of distributed components. In cloud-native environments, it is crucial as it enables elastic scaling and high availability through service decoupling, widely applied in scenarios such as e-commerce and finance to support rapid iteration and fault isolation.

Core methods include synchronous communication (e.g., HTTP/REST or gRPC calls) and asynchronous communication (e.g., message queue Apache Kafka). Features involve service discovery for dynamic service location, API gateways for unified request routing, and service meshes for managing load balancing and fault tolerance. In practical applications, Kubernetes配合Istio等服务网格自动化流量控制, event-driven architecture achieves loose coupling, improving system performance and agile development efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1) Deploy service mesh and configure policies, 2) Define API contracts to standardize interfaces, 3) Integrate message brokers to handle asynchronous tasks. Typical scenarios include event-driven queues during order processing. Business values include reducing dependencies, accelerating deployment, lowering fault risks, and ultimately enhancing business continuity and innovation speed.
