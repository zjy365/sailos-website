CI/CD pipeline performance metrics are used to measure the efficiency and health of continuous integration/deployment pipelines, such as build time and deployment success rate. Their importance lies in optimizing the software delivery process, ensuring fast and reliable releases, and they are widely applied in cloud-native environments and DevOps practices to enhance team productivity.

Core metrics include build time, failure rate, test coverage, and deployment frequency. Real-time monitoring is achieved through tools like Prometheus and Jenkins plugins, with features including data visualization and alert mechanisms. In practical applications, they help identify bottlenecks, reduce MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery), promote agile development, and enhance the stability of cloud applications.

During implementation: first, define key metrics such as deployment frequency; then integrate monitoring tools like Grafana and set up dashboards; then regularly review data to optimize the pipeline; a typical scenario is the continuous delivery of cloud-native applications; business value is reflected in reducing operational costs by 20-30%, accelerating release cycles, and improving customer satisfaction.
