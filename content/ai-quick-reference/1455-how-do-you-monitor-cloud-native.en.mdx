Monitoring resource utilization of cloud-native applications involves real-time tracking of CPU and memory consumption of containers like Pods, which is crucial for optimizing performance, controlling costs, and ensuring reliability, especially in supporting application scalability in Kubernetes environments.

Core tools include Prometheus for collecting time-series metrics, Grafana for building visualization dashboards, and Kubernetes Metrics Server for providing basic API data; the principle is based on metric exposure and aggregation mechanisms, and practical applications are used for auto-scaling decisions and fault diagnosis, significantly improving resource utilization.

Implementation steps: Deploy monitoring stacks such as installing Prometheus-Grafana via helm; configure metric collection to export Pod resource data; set up alerts and views through Grafana. A typical scenario is during high-traffic business hours, where the business value lies in reducing costs and enhancing system resilience through dynamic scaling.
