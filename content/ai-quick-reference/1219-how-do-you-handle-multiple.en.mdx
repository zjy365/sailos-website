In CI/CD, handling multiple environments (development, testing, production) is a core practice for automated software deployment. It involves gradually validating and releasing code through isolated stages to ensure quality, reduce risks, and especially improve iteration efficiency in agile development and large enterprise applications.

Core components include environment configuration management (such as Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets), automated CI/CD tools (such as GitLab or Jenkins), and pipeline workflow design. The principle revolves around version control settings and automated triggering logic, where the development environment executes unit tests, the testing environment conducts integration tests, and production deployment requires automated or manual approval. This enhances reliability and reduces production failure rates.

Implementation steps: 1) Define environment parameters and version configurations; 2) Set up pipeline stages, such as automatic build testing in development, integration verification after test deployment, and approval required for production; 3) Use environment variables to manage sensitive settings. The business value is to accelerate release cycles, optimize resource utilization, and improve software stability.
