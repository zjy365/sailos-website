Observability is the ability to understand the state of a system through logs, metrics, and tracing data. When managing multiple cloud-native services in a hybrid cloud environment, ensuring unified monitoring is crucial to maintain high availability, optimize performance, and quickly locate faults. Application scenarios include microservice architectures running across public/private clouds.

Its core components include logging (collecting event information), metric monitoring (tracking performance data), and distributed tracing (mapping request flows). Features are based on standardization such as the OpenTelemetry protocol to achieve data consistency. In practical applications, tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger implement end-to-end visibility, significantly improving operational efficiency, shortening problem resolution time, and enhancing system resilience.

Implementation steps: 1. Standardize data collection, deploy OpenTelemetry agents to integrate various cloud services; 2. Establish a central storage (such as Loki or Elasticsearch) to aggregate data; 3. Create unified dashboards through visualization tools (such as Grafana); 4. Configure automated alerts. Typical business values include reducing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), improving service stability, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
