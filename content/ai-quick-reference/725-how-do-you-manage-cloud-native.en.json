  "content": "Cloud-native data backup refers to storing copies of data in containerized and Kubernetes environments, while regulatory standards such as GDPR or HIPAA ensure data privacy and security. Its importance lies in safeguarding business continuity, preventing data loss, and meeting legal requirements. It is applied in regulated industries such as finance and healthcare to ensure reliable data recovery.\n\nThe core components include automated backup tools (such as Velero or Kasten K10), end-to-end encryption mechanisms, and retention policy settings. The principle is based on Kubernetes CRDs to implement distributed, immutable backups. In practical applications, Operators are used to manage regular snapshots and recovery tests, significantly improving data resilience and compliance, and reducing audit risks and fines.\n\nImplementation steps include: 1. Assess applicable regulations; 2. Select compatible cloud tools; 3. Design strategies (frequency, retention period); 4. Deploy encryption and access control; 5. Conduct regular recovery tests. Typical scenarios involve disaster recovery drills, and the business value is to reduce operational disruption risks, ensure continuity, and maintain corporate reputation."
