  "content": "Running applications in a multi-cloud environment involves multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure), enhancing resilience and avoiding lock-in risks. Serverless architecture automatically executes code through event-driven mechanisms (such as AWS Lambda), eliminating the need for infrastructure management. Its importance lies in pay-as-you-go pricing and automatic scaling, with application scenarios including cross-cloud data processing and event-triggered applications (such as web backends).\n\nIts core components include Function as a Service (FaaS), event sources (API Gateway or queue services), and containerized runtime environments; features include statelessness, rapid deployment, and pay-per-execution billing. In practical applications, it supports elastic workflows (such as multi-cloud data analysis pipelines), with impacts including improved agility, reduced operational burden, accelerated innovation, and optimized costs.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Evaluate multi-cloud compatibility and select standard tools (such as Knative or AWS Lambda); 2. Define event sources (using message queues or APIs); 3. Deploy function code (containerization ensures cross-platform compatibility); 4. Integrate management and monitoring tools (such as Terraform for infrastructure orchestration); 5. Continuously optimize performance. Business values include reduced costs, improved reliability, and enhanced business agility."
