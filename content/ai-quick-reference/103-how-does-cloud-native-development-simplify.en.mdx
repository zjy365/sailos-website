Cloud-native development simplifies the dependency management process by integrating containerization and automation technologies, reducing environment conflicts and configuration complexity. Dependency management involves coordinating external libraries or services required by applications, which is highly important in microservice architectures, supporting agile iteration and multi-environment deployment, such as elastic scaling scenarios in Kubernetes clusters.

The core principles include containerization (e.g., Docker images) encapsulating dependencies and runtime environments to ensure consistency; service discovery (via K8s DNS or Istio mesh) automatically handling inter-service dependencies; and CI/CD pipelines automating testing, image building, and deployment. This reduces manual dependency configuration errors, improves collaboration efficiency between microservices, and directly affects application resilience and release frequency.

Implementation steps are: 1. Containerize applications and their dependencies; 2. Integrate service discovery and configuration management tools; 3. Automate build and deployment processes. Business values include accelerating development cycles (reducing environment issues), improving system stability (minimizing configuration differences), and lowering operation and maintenance costs.
