  "content": "Managing database scaling in a cloud-native environment refers to dynamically adjusting database size using automated tools to adapt to load changes, which is core to ensuring high availability, elasticity, and performance optimization in microservices architectures. Its importance lies in coping with sudden traffic such as e-commerce events, supporting seamless application scaling, and avoiding downtime risks.\n\nThe core principles include: relying on Kubernetes orchestration tools to achieve horizontal or vertical scaling, and automating strategies such as sharding and data replication through custom Operators. Key features are declarative configuration and auto-scaling, which are applied in stateful services to improve data processing efficiency, reduce resource waste, and ensure system reliability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Determine the scaling strategy; 2. Integrate automated tools such as setting up HPA; 3. Monitor metrics such as CPU load to adjust resources. A typical scenario is handling traffic peaks, and the business values brought include cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and enhanced resilience."
