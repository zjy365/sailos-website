  "content": "Secure communication in microservices-based applications ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmission between services, using encryption and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data and complying with regulations such as GDPR, applicable to distributed systems like financial payments or medical records.\n\nCore components include Transport Layer Security (TLS) for encrypting data, mutual TLS (mTLS) for bidirectional authentication, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization mechanisms. Service mesh tools like Istio or Linkerd automate the deployment of these features, enhancing security through centralized policy management and end-to-end monitoring, with practical impacts including reduced attack surfaces and improved overall system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: first, enable TLS certificates for all services; second, deploy service mesh tools to automate mTLS; third, define fine-grained authorization policies; finally, integrate monitoring and log auditing. Business values include enhanced data protection, reduced cost risks, and support for reliable scaling in agile development environments."
