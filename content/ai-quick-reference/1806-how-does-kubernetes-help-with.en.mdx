Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform, primarily used for managing cloud-native applications. It automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications, simplifying DevOps processes. Its importance lies in supporting microservices architecture, elastic scaling, and continuous delivery, with wide application in building highly reliable and portable cloud environments, such as distributed systems and container-based services.

Its core components include Nodes, Pods, Services, and Deployments, enabling automatic scaling, self-healing, and load balancing. Based on the principle of declarative configuration, Kubernetes ensures application fault recovery and high availability. In practical applications, it significantly reduces manual operations, improves resource utilization and system stability, accelerates cloud-native transformation, and promotes agile development and observability.

Implementation steps involve defining Deployment description files, configuring Services to expose applications, setting up HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) for automatic scaling, and integrating monitoring tools. Typical scenarios include running independent microservice clusters. Business value includes shortening release cycles, optimizing costs, and enhancing business continuity through elastic response to demand changes.
