CI/CD pipeline is an automated software delivery process, primarily used to enable rapid deployment and reduce human errors. Its importance lies in accelerating the release of new features and fixes, thereby improving system stability; application scenarios include emergency hotfixes such as security vulnerability patches to ensure service continuity.

The core components include Continuous Integration (automated building and testing of code) and Continuous Deployment (automatic push to the production environment). Features are automated workflows and rapid feedback loops. In practical applications, efficient pipelines shorten the hotfix deployment cycle, reduce operational risks, and enhance software reliability.

Implementation steps include: creating an isolated fix branch, writing and committing code changes, triggering the CI/CD pipeline to execute automated tests (such as unit and regression tests), and automatically deploying to the production environment; a typical scenario is security patch deployment; the business value is zero-downtime updates, improving user experience and reducing potential losses.
