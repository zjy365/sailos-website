  "content": "Cloud-native development is an application building method based on cloud infrastructure, emphasizing containerization, microservices, and automated CI/CD processes. Its importance lies in improving development efficiency and application reliability, reducing environment discrepancy issues, and it is suitable for large-scale distributed systems and agile development scenarios.\n\nCore components include microservice architecture to split application logic, container technologies (such as Docker) to encapsulate runtime environments, Kubernetes orchestration for automated deployment, and CI/CD pipelines for integrated testing. This standardizes the development process, promotes team collaboration through environmental consistency, and improves code quality with automated testing and real-time feedback, reducing deployment errors and defects.\n\nIn implementation, containers provide a unified environment to simplify collaboration, CI/CD is set up for automated testing to ensure quality standards, and microservices support parallel development to reduce conflicts. Typical scenarios include cross-team agile projects, with business values including accelerating iteration cycles, improving software stability, and reducing costs."
