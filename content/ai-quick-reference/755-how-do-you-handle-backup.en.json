  "content": "Hybrid cloud environments integrate public and private cloud resources. Cloud-native databases, such as PostgreSQL or Cassandra running on Kubernetes, need to handle backup and replication to ensure data consistency, high availability, and disaster recovery, which are crucial for cross-cloud business continuity and compliance scenarios.\n\nThe core components include using Velero to back up persistent volumes to object storage (e.g., AWS S3) and database-built-in replication (e.g., asynchronous streaming replication). Features involve snapshot and logging mechanisms, with principles based on consistency and parallel processing. In practical applications, backing up data to the public cloud and replicating to off-site nodes significantly enhances fault tolerance and meets requirements such as GDPR.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy Velero and configure backup plans to cloud storage. 2. Enable database replication and set up a master-slave architecture. 3. Monitor and test recovery. Typical scenarios include cross-region failover, bringing business values such as minimizing downtime, reducing the risk of data loss, and optimizing costs."
