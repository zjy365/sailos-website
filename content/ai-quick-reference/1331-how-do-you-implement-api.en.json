  "content": "API testing verifies the functionality, performance, and security of application programming interfaces, which is crucial in cloud-native CI/CD pipelines to ensure the reliability and compatibility of microservices in dynamically deployed environments. It is widely applied in agile development and DevOps scenarios, supporting automated quality assurance and rapid iteration.\n\nThe core components include automated testing frameworks (such as Postman or K6), test scripts, assertions, and data management. The integration principle is to add a dedicated testing phase (e.g., after build) in the pipeline, which is automatically executed through event-driven mechanisms. This promotes early defect detection, reduces production errors, and significantly improves deployment efficiency and system stability.\n\nImplementation steps: Select tools like RestAssured; develop test case scripts; configure automated tasks in CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions); set trigger rules to run tests; analyze reports to provide immediate feedback. Typical scenarios support A/B testing, and business values include shortening delivery cycles, improving user satisfaction, and reducing maintenance costs."
