Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines infrastructure resources through declarative scripts, ensuring consistency and repeatability. Optimizing its cost-effectiveness is crucial to reduce resource waste in cloud environments and avoid cost overruns, applicable to automated cloud-native application deployments such as Kubernetes cluster management.

Core components include resource definitions, version control, and automated configuration management. Features involve auditability, script reuse, and change tracking. In practical applications, by optimizing script parameters such as instance size and storage type, over-provisioning is reduced, resource utilization is improved, which positively impacts cost control and cloud-native governance.

Implementation steps: 1. Code review to identify redundant configurations; 2. Apply resource tags to track ownership; 3. Integrate cost monitoring tools like AWS Cost Explorer; 4. Adjust script parameters based on reports. Typical scenarios involve optimizing resource allocation during the development cycle, reducing cloud bills by up to 30%, and improving return on investment.
