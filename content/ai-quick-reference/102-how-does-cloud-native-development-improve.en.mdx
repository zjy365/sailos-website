Cloud-native development builds applications using cloud computing technologies, emphasizing microservices and automated deployment. Its importance lies in promoting agility, optimizing resource usage, and being applied in scenarios such as internet services. It can reduce the isolation between development and operations and enhance collaboration through shared platforms.

The core components include splitting applications into microservices, containerization (such as Docker) to ensure environmental consistency, Kubernetes for automated resource orchestration, and CI/CD to achieve continuous integration and delivery. This reduces manual intervention, improves deployment efficiency, directly affects collaboration quality, and enables seamless environment management and rapid fault recovery.

Teams promote cross-functional collaboration by implementing infrastructure as code (such as Terraform), integrating CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins), and establishing a culture of shared responsibility. This brings business value, such as shortening release cycles, improving system reliability, and enhancing team efficiency.
