  "content": "In a cloud-native environment, enforcing security standards involves ensuring the security of containerized applications on platforms like Kubernetes. Its importance lies in reducing the risks of data breaches and compliance violations, supporting regulatory requirements in critical industries such as healthcare and finance, and enhancing overall architectural resilience and credibility.\n\nThe core components include policy engines (such as Open Policy Agent), admission controllers, and auditing tools. Declarative policies are defined based on languages like Rego, and validation is performed by automatically intercepting resource requests; in practical applications, tools like Gatekeeper implement admission control, reducing configuration errors and image vulnerabilities, strengthening continuous security compliance, and simplifying operations and maintenance.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Develop security policy specifications (e.g., image scanning rules); 2. Deploy policy enforcement mechanisms (such as Kubernetes admission webhooks); 3. Monitor and audit (using tools like Falco). Typical scenarios include network policy isolation, with business values of automated security protection, improved compliance efficiency, and reduced costs."
