  "content": "Managing microservice dependencies in a CI/CD pipeline involves coordinating the deployment order and compatibility of multiple independent services. This is crucial because improper handling of API or event dependencies between microservices can lead to deployment failures or system outages. Typical application scenarios include situations where the order service in an e-commerce platform depends on the inventory service.\n\nCore methods include: defining service interface contracts (such as OpenAPI/Swagger specifications), implementing contract testing to ensure version compatibility, and using service meshes (such as Istio) for traffic governance. In practical applications, dependency health checks and service discovery mechanisms can automatically detect the status of downstream services; adopting a loosely coupled event-driven architecture (such as Kafka) reduces direct dependencies and avoids deployment bottlenecks.\n\nManagement steps: first, define semantic versions for each service and publish interface contracts; second, integrate contract testing in the CI phase to verify dependency compatibility; then deploy parent services sequentially or via blue-green deployment; finally, track dependency health through monitoring (such as Prometheus) and trigger rollbacks. This improves deployment reliability and shortens delivery cycles."
