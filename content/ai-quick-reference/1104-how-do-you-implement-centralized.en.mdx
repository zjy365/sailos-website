Centralized management of multi-cloud environments refers to controlling multiple cloud services (such as AWS, Azure) through a unified platform to reduce complexity and improve efficiency, applied in enterprise hybrid cloud, disaster recovery, and cost optimization scenarios. Its core components include multi-cloud management platforms (such as Kubernetes multi-cluster management tools), API integration, and automation strategies, providing centralized monitoring, resource configuration compliance, and unified security policy enforcement, affecting cloud-native transformation and resource elastic scaling. Implementation steps include evaluating cloud provider compatibility, selecting platforms (such as Rancher or OpenShift), integrating APIs and management consoles, and deploying automation tools; typical scenarios include load balancing and cross-cloud backup, with business value involving a 30% reduction in operational costs and improved security.
