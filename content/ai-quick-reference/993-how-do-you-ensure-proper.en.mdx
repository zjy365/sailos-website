User access control manages user access permissions to resources in cloud-native systems, whose importance lies in ensuring data security, preventing unauthorized access, and supporting compliance, applicable to containerized microservices and application scenarios in cloud environments.

The core components include authentication (such as OAuth/OIDC), authorization mechanisms (such as role-based RBAC and attribute-based ABAC), and audit logs. Through the implementation of Kubernetes' RBAC policies and service meshes like Istio, fine-grained permission control can be achieved, enhancing system security and facilitating the implementation of a zero-trust architecture.

Implementation steps include: first defining roles and permission scopes; then deploying an identity provider for user authentication; configuring Kubernetes RBAC rules or using cloud-native tools like OPA; and finally enabling audit monitoring for abnormal activities. This reduces business risks, ensures the principle of least privilege, and compliance.
