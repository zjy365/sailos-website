  "content": "In the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflow, key management refers to the importance of securely handling sensitive data such as API keys and passwords to prevent their leakage in code. This is crucial for automated deployments (such as cloud-native and Kubernetes), ensuring compliance and reducing security risks.\n\nCore components include the use of secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager), combined with encrypted storage, dynamic injection, and the principle of least privilege. Features involve key rotation and audit logs to ensure real-time security. Practical applications include dynamically accessing secrets in IaC tools (e.g., Terraform), enhancing the trustworthiness of CI/CD pipelines.\n\nProcessing steps include: 1. Removing hard-coded keys to a secret repository; 2. IaC scripts referencing environment variables or providers; 3. CI/CD integration for dynamic retrieval; 4. Implementing automatic rotation. Typical scenarios include cloud deployments, with business values of enhancing security, reducing operational risks, and accelerating automated scaling."
