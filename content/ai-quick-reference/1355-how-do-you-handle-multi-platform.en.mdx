In CI/CD pipelines, multi-platform building refers to an automated build process that supports different operating systems or hardware architectures (such as Linux/x86, Windows/ARM). Its importance lies in ensuring that applications run seamlessly in diverse environments. Application scenarios include cloud-native deployment, cross-platform microservices, and IoT device compatibility.

Core features involve containerization tools (such as Docker Buildx), which use QEMU emulators to build multi-platform images at once. In principle, it reduces repetitive work by standardizing build configurations. In practical applications, it can improve deployment efficiency, compatibility, and resource utilization, and has a significant positive impact on the fields of hybrid cloud and edge computing.

Implementation steps: Integrate supporting tools (such as Buildx) into the CI system; configure the build file to specify the platform list; execute the build and run tests; push the image to the repository, and finally deploy to the target environment. This simplifies the release process, shortens time-to-market, and enables business expansion into new hardware ecosystems.
