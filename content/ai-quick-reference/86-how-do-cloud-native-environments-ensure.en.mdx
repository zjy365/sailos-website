Cloud-native environments utilize dynamic cloud computing resources for application deployment. High availability ensures applications continue running during failures, which is crucial for production systems such as financial or e-commerce platforms, supporting business continuity.

Core mechanisms include Kubernetes orchestrating multi-replica containers, health probes automatically detecting and restarting failed instances, and horizontal scaling to handle load fluctuations. Rolling updates and partitioned deployments are used to avoid single points of failure, enhance resilience, and reduce downtime.

Implementation steps: Deploy multi-replica applications and configure automatic recovery strategies such as Pod restarts; integrate load balancers and service meshes. Business values include zero-downtime updates, elastic scaling, improved user experience, and reduced interruption risks.
