Distributed data management refers to methods of storing and processing data across multiple nodes, ensuring consistency, availability, and scalability. Its importance lies in supporting large-scale distributed systems such as cloud computing and high-concurrency application scenarios. In a microservices architecture, it enables independent deployment of services and data autonomy.

Core components include data partitioning, replication mechanisms, and consistency models (such as the CAP theorem). Features involve eventual consistency and partition tolerance. In practical applications, it impacts how microservices handle cross-service transactions through event-driven architectures or Saga patterns, enhancing resilience and loose coupling.

Work in microservices involves steps: 1. Each service manages a dedicated database. 2. Implement asynchronous communication using message queues or event sourcing. 3. Coordinate transactions to maintain eventual consistency. Business values include improved maintainability, support for horizontal scaling, and handling failure recovery.
