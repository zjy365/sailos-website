CI/CD pipeline is a key framework for automated software delivery, emphasizing continuous integration and continuous deployment to accelerate releases. Custom deployment rules allow teams to control the deployment process based on specific conditions (such as environment, branch, or test results), enhancing reliability, flexibility, and security. Its importance lies in reducing the risk of manual intervention and supporting multi-environment management, such as blue-green deployment or canary release scenarios.

The core components of this concept include a configurable rule engine (such as Jenkins scripts or conditional statements in GitHub Actions), environment variable integration, and event-based trigger logic (such as allowing only the main branch to deploy to production). Features include automation, fault tolerance, and manual approval gates to ensure environment isolation and policy enforcement. In practical applications, such as using Argo CD in Kubernetes to define canary rules, it can significantly impact DevOps efficiency, accelerate release cycles, and reduce downtime.

Implementation steps include: first, configuring CI/CD tool files (such as .gitlab-ci.yml) and defining rule logic (for example, using if statements to restrict deployment to specific environments); second, integrating testing and approval mechanisms; finally, verifying the accuracy of the rules through the test environment. Typical scenarios include phased rollouts or business values such as rapid iteration to minimize risk and optimize resource utilization.
