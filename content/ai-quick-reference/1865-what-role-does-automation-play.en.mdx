Automation is crucial in cloud-native application development, responsible for simplifying processes, improving efficiency, and ensuring consistency. Its core roles include supporting continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), fault isolation, and infrastructure management, applied in scenarios of rapid iteration and high availability.

Key components include CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes), and infrastructure as code (IaC). These elements enable automatic building, testing, deployment, and scaling of applications, based on the principle of declarative configuration. The practical impacts are accelerating time to market, enhancing reliability, and reducing human intervention, driving agile development.

Applications are reflected in automated testing, rolling updates, and monitoring; the value lies in optimizing costs, improving development efficiency and business responsiveness, ensuring scalability and resilience to meet the dynamic needs of cloud environments.
