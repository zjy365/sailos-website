Observability data includes metrics, logs, and traces, reflecting the real-time state of the system. Integrating machine learning tools enables predictive analysis, such as predicting failures or optimizing resources, to enhance reliability and efficiency in cloud-native environments.

The core process involves data collection (e.g., using Prometheus or ELK Stack), feature engineering, and model training (e.g., LSTM for time-series data). In practical applications, predicting bottlenecks or failure events allows automated responses like scaling, significantly reducing downtime and operational costs.

Implementation steps include: data ingestion into the ML platform; feature extraction; model training and deployment; and continuous monitoring feedback. Typical scenarios such as demand forecasting or anomaly detection deliver business value including improved system availability, enhanced user experience, and reduced costs.
