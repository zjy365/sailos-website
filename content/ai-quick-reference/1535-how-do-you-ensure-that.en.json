  "content": "In a hybrid IT environment, it is crucial for monitoring tools to support both legacy applications and cloud-native applications, as it uniformly ensures performance, security, and reliability, applicable to cloud migration projects and hybrid cloud deployment scenarios.\n\nThe core includes support for diverse data sources (such as logs, metrics, traces), scalable architectures (such as Prometheus-based platforms), and agent-based or agentless integration methods. In practical applications, this enables cross-environment monitoring through unified dashboards, improving operational efficiency and reducing fault detection time.\n\nImplementation steps: Assess application environment requirements; select compatible tools (such as Prometheus integrated with local agents); deploy and configure agents; implement data aggregation and visualization. A typical scenario is transitional operation and maintenance, with business values including reducing downtime risks, optimizing resource costs, and accelerating problem resolution."
