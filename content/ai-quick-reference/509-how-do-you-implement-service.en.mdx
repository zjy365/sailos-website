Service resilience is a key capability for microservice systems to maintain available services under failures or load pressure. In a microservice environment, due to multiple dependencies between services, risks include cascading failures and service disruptions. Resilience mechanisms ensure high reliability and business continuity through fault-tolerant design, with application scenarios such as e-commerce transaction platforms responding to sudden traffic or API failures.

Its core components include the circuit breaker pattern to interrupt faulty service calls, retry logic to handle transient errors, and timeout settings to avoid resource exhaustion. Features include automatic fault detection and recovery, supporting redundant deployment to isolate impacts. In practical applications, Kubernetes monitors service health through liveness probes and ensures redundancy with replica sets; service meshes like Istio provide dynamic routing and rate limiting, significantly improving system resilience and reducing downtime.

Implementation steps: First, integrate Hystrix or Resilience4j to implement circuit breakers; second, configure API retry strategies and timeout thresholds; finally, deploy the service mesh in Kubernetes and set up Prometheus monitoring alerts. A typical scenario is retrying the backup service when the order processing API call fails. Business value includes improved user satisfaction and reduced downtime losses, ensuring continuous operation.
