  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows the automation of infrastructure management and provisioning through code, improving deployment consistency and repeatability. It is crucial in automated cloud security auditing, ensuring continuous compliance of cloud environments and reducing security risks, applicable to configuration auditing and threat detection in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud scenarios.\n\nCore components include IaC tools (such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation), security auditing frameworks (such as AWS Config or Open Policy Agent), and automation pipelines. Features include version control, declarative configuration, and real-time monitoring. In practical applications, IaC templates embed security policies to automatically audit resource configuration deviations or vulnerabilities, significantly enhancing compliance, reducing human errors, and supporting rapid response to security incidents.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define cloud resources (such as VPC or storage buckets) using IaC. 2. Integrate security scanning tools (such as Checkov or Azure Policy) into CI/CD pipelines. 3. Automate audit execution and report generation. 4. Set up alert and remediation workflows. Business values include reducing vulnerability exposure time, saving audit costs by over 30%, and achieving continuous security governance."
