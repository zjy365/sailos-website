  "content": "It is crucial to implement global monitoring for cloud-native applications deployed across multiple regions, as it provides unified visibility across geographical areas, ensuring high availability, performance optimization, and rapid failure recovery of applications. Its application scenarios include cross-regional microservice systems or global user platforms, supporting continuous operation of highly reliable businesses.\n\nThe core components of global monitoring include a central data store (such as Prometheus with Thanos), log aggregation tools (such as the ELK Stack), and distributed tracing systems (such as Jaeger). These components collect metrics from various regions through proxies, enabling real-time data analysis, alarm configuration, and dashboard integration. This architecture enhances fault tolerance, enabling rapid identification of bottlenecks, optimization of resource allocation, and reduction of cross-regional interruption risks in practice.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Select a global monitoring framework; 2. Configure regional proxies to collect data; 3. Establish central dashboards and alarm strategies; 4. Integrate tracing tools; 5. Test and optimize monitoring latency. This brings business value such as improved SLAs, reduced downtime costs, and enhanced customer experience."
