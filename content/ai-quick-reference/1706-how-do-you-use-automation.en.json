  "content": "Automated configuration refers to the automatic execution of security policy deployment through tools, which is a core component of cloud-native security. It ensures consistency and compliance in large-scale deployments, applicable to Kubernetes clusters, container images, and microservice architectures, effectively defending against zero-day vulnerabilities and configuration errors.\n\nThe core includes infrastructure as code tools (such as Terraform), CI/CD pipeline integration of policy as code (such as OPA/Gatekeeper), and runtime security monitoring. Through declarative policy management, it automatically implements continuous scanning of image vulnerabilities, network isolation, and least privilege, elevating security baselines and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR.\n\nImplementation steps are: 1. Define security policies (e.g., CIS benchmarks); 2. Select an automated toolchain (e.g., integrating Falco+Trivy); 3. Embed into CI/CD processes for testing and execution; 4. Real-time auditing and automatic remediation. Typical scenarios include pre-container startup verification and intrusion response, with business value of reducing 90% of human configuration risks and shortening compliance audit cycles."
