Observability refers to the ability to understand the internal state of an application through data such as logs, metrics, and traces. It is crucial in cloud-native environments, helping operation and maintenance teams monitor system health, diagnose issues, and respond promptly. It is mainly applied in distributed systems to support troubleshooting, performance optimization, and user experience analysis.

The core components include logs that record event details, metrics that quantify system performance (such as request rates), and traces that show request paths. Its characteristics emphasize real-time performance, relevance, and contextual integrity. In practical applications, it can identify user behavior patterns (such as peak access), improve system reliability and development efficiency, with impacts including reducing service interruptions and accelerating decision-making.

To track usage patterns, first deploy tools such as Prometheus to collect metrics, Fluentd to process logs, and Jaeger to manage traces. Then configure data collection and analysis pipelines, and use dashboards to visualize user interactions. A typical scenario is an e-commerce platform monitoring user purchasing behavior. The business value lies in optimizing feature design, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing operational costs.
