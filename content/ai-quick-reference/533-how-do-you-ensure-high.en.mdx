Microservices deployment is a software architectural style that decomposes an application into small, independent services; High Availability (HA) ensures the system continues to operate during failures, which is crucial for avoiding downtime, enhancing user experience, and improving business continuity, and is commonly used in cloud-native applications such as e-commerce or financial platforms.

The core components include redundant deployment (multiple instances), load balancing for traffic distribution, health checks to automatically recover failed services, and failover strategies. In Kubernetes, ReplicaSets maintain the number of replicas, and service discovery optimizes communication to enhance resilience; this reduces the risk of single points of failure, adapts to dynamic loads, and improves system stability.

Implementation steps include: deploying multiple service replicas to achieve redundancy; using load balancers such as Nginx to balance requests; configuring health checks to automatically restart abnormal instances; and applying Kubernetes' rolling updates to avoid deployment interruptions. The business value lies in maximizing uptime, reducing revenue loss, and supporting critical scenarios such as 24/7 online services.
