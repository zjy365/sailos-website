  "content": "Service-to-service authentication refers to the mechanism by which microservices verify each other's identities during communication. Its importance lies in ensuring the security of distributed systems, preventing unauthorized access, and it is applicable to API calls and event-driven interaction scenarios to enhance overall trust.\n\nCore components include JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for传递 identity information, mutual TLS (mTLS) for encrypted authentication, API gateways for centralized processing, and OAuth2 protocol integration. The principle is based on the zero-trust model, verifying the legitimacy of services through encrypted credentials. In practical applications, it reduces the risk of data leakage, simplifies permission management, and strengthens service interoperability in service mesh environments.\n\nImplementation steps are: 1. Deploy an API gateway or service mesh (such as Istio) proxy to handle authentication; 2. Configure automatic management of mTLS certificates; 3. Integrate with an identity provider (such as Keycloak) to issue tokens. The business value is enhancing security, reducing operational burden, accelerating compliance adherence (such as GDPR), and minimizing human errors through automation."
