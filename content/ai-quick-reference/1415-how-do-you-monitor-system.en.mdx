In a cloud-native environment, monitoring system health involves tracking the operational status of applications, service availability, and resource consumption (such as CPU and memory) to ensure high availability, performance optimization, and rapid fault response, applied in scenarios like Kubernetes cluster management for microservice architectures.

Core components include metric collection tools (e.g., Prometheus), logging systems (e.g., Fluentd and Elasticsearch), and container health probes (e.g., Kubernetes liveness probes), which support automated scaling through real-time data aggregation and alerting mechanisms, enhancing system stability and resource efficiency.

Implementation steps include deploying Prometheus with exporters to collect metrics, configuring Kubernetes health checks, setting up Alertmanager notification rules, and using Grafana for visualization dashboards. Typical use cases include maintaining microservice availability, with business values such as reducing downtime risks, optimizing costs, and enhancing user experience.
