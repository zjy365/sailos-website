Public clouds are managed by third-party providers (such as AWS), offering shared resources, elastic scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing, suitable for cost-sensitive and widely accessible scenarios. Private clouds are dedicated to a single organization, deployed either internally or via managed services, ensuring high control, security, and compliance, ideal for sensitive data processing. Hybrid clouds integrate both, enabling workload migration through networking to balance flexibility and optimize resources, serving diverse business needs.

The core differences lie in ownership, management models, and security. Public clouds feature multi-tenant architectures, low costs but provider dependency; private clouds emphasize exclusive environments, customization but higher capital expenditure; hybrid clouds rely on integration technologies (e.g., APIs) to achieve cross-cloud consistency, applied in disaster recovery and peak load distribution. Practical impacts include IT transformation, cost control, and driving innovation.

Application value focuses on optimizing resource utilization, enhancing risk management, and improving business agility. Enterprises select the appropriate model based on compliance requirements, scalability needs, and innovation goals—for example, using public clouds for startup testing, private clouds for core systems, and hybrid clouds to support dynamic scaling and compliant storage.
