  "content": "Monitoring in cloud-native environments refers to the real-time collection, aggregation, and analysis of operational status data (metrics, logs, traces) of applications, infrastructure, and services in containerized, dynamically orchestrated (e.g., Kubernetes), and microservices architectures. Its importance lies in the fact that the dynamic, complex, and distributed nature of cloud-native environments renders traditional monitoring ineffective, necessitating real-time insights into health status, rapid fault localization, ensuring service resilience and reliability, and supporting automated operational decision-making.\n\nCore features include the collection of container performance metrics, tracing of inter-microservice call chains, correlated analysis of distributed logs, and declarative alerting strategies. Key technologies encompass time-series database storage (e.g., Prometheus), log aggregation (e.g., ELK/EFK), observability components (e.g., OpenTelemetry), and display through unified dashboards. Autoscaling, SLO保障 and fault self-healing heavily rely on the data it provides.\n\nIts application value lies in ensuring business continuity and optimizing resource utilization: quickly diagnosing cross-service faults to shorten MTTR; performing intelligent scaling based on metrics (e.g., HPA); ensuring compliance with SLO/SLA requirements; and ultimately achieving high application availability, enhancing user experience, and reducing operational costs."
