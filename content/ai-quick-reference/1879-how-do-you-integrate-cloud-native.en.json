  "content": "Cloud-native applications are deployed on containerized and dynamically orchestrated platforms such as Kubernetes. Integrating external APIs and services is crucial for extending functionality and enabling data exchange, enhancing flexibility and interoperability, which is common in microservice architectures and hybrid cloud environments.\n\nThe core manages incoming traffic through an API gateway, with service meshes (e.g., Istio) handling inter-service communication and load balancing, combined with message queues to achieve loose coupling. The principle is based on service discovery and policy enforcement, ensuring observability and fault recovery, driving efficient development and system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy an API gateway such as Nginx to configure routing; set up a service mesh to connect external services; apply authentication mechanisms like OAuth2 to ensure security. Business values include accelerating innovation, reducing latency, and supporting scalable business models."
