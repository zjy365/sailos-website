  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure using code, with key concepts including version-controlled configuration files and automated deployment. Its importance lies in ensuring the consistency, repeatability, and auditability of Kubernetes namespaces and resource configurations, thereby avoiding manual errors. Application scenarios include DevOps pipelines and multi-environment (e.g., development and production) setups, enabling rapid deployment and maintenance of cloud-native applications.\n\nCore components include IaC tools (such as Terraform, Ansible, or Pulumi) and declarative configuration files (such as HCL or YAML), which define Kubernetes objects like namespaces, Deployments, and Services. Features include reusable templates, state management, and dependency handling. In practical applications, defining resources ensures environment isolation and automated resource quotas. The impacts include improved efficiency, reduced operational costs, and support for GitOps workflow integration.\n\nImplementation steps: Select an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform with Kubernetes provider); write configuration files to define namespaces (e.g., resource \"\"kubernetes_namespace\"\") and related resources; integrate CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate the apply operation. Typical scenarios involve environment deployment and updates; business value is reflected in accelerated iteration, ensured compliance, and saved labor costs."
