Automated development and testing environment setup ensures environment consistency through tools, reduces manual configuration errors and version differences, and improves development efficiency. Its importance lies in accelerating iterations and ensuring test reliability, applied in CI/CD processes, continuous delivery, and team collaboration scenarios.

The core includes infrastructure as code, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines. Features are code-defined configurations, one-click deployment, and automated test triggering. The principle is to ensure environment repeatability through version control. In practical applications, it reduces configuration drift, improves development and testing efficiency, and speeds up business response.

Implementation steps include: defining environment configuration code using tools like Terraform or Docker Compose, setting up automated build and deployment scripts, and integrating testing frameworks such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions. Typical scenarios include automatically creating environments before functional testing. Business values are shortening release cycles, reducing operational costs, and improving product quality.
