  "content": "In cloud-native applications, microservice communication security ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data transmission between services, preventing data leakage and man-in-the-middle attacks. This topic is crucial because cloud-native architectures such as Kubernetes rely on distributed microservices, with application scenarios including e-commerce platforms and financial services that need to maintain compliance and availability in highly dynamic environments.\n\nCore components include transport layer security protocols (e.g., TLS/mTLS) for end-to-end encryption, and service meshes like Istio for automatic certificate and policy management. Features include mutual authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT/OAuth), based on the zero-trust model in principle. Practical applications involve integrating API gateways or service meshes to control communications, significantly reducing attack risks, enhancing system resilience, and enabling enterprises to achieve automated security governance.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy a service mesh framework (e.g., Istio); configure mTLS as the default communication mode; set up identity provider service registration; apply fine-grained authorization policies (e.g., RBAC); monitor audit logs. A typical scenario is microservice interaction in Kubernetes clusters, with business values including data privacy protection, regulatory compliance optimization, and reduced operational costs by mitigating vulnerabilities."
