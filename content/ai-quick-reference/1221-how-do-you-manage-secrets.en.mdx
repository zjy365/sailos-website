Managing keys and sensitive data in CI/CD pipelines involves protecting credentials such as API keys and database passwords to prevent leaks. Its importance lies in ensuring the security and compliance of automated delivery, avoiding data breaches, and applying to cloud-native environments like Kubernetes deployments, where sensitive information is often used in the build and deployment phases.

Core components include dedicated secret management tools such as HashiCorp Vault or cloud services like AWS Secrets Manager, featuring encrypted storage, role-based access control, and automatic rotation. The principle is to centrally manage secrets and minimize exposure; in practical application, these tools are integrated through CI platform plugins (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions) to securely extract and inject secrets, with impacts including enhancing security posture, reducing manual errors, and supporting the implementation of zero-trust architecture.

Implementation steps include: 1) Identifying all sensitive data in the pipeline; 2) Adopting secret storage services to store encrypted values; 3) Retrieving via environment variables or API calls in CI scripts; 4) Ensuring end-to-end auditing and monitoring. A typical scenario is dynamically injecting keys into test or deployment scripts; the business value is reducing leakage risks, accelerating secure releases, and meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR.
