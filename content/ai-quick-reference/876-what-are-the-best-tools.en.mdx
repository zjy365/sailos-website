Monitoring the security of cloud-native applications requires continuous detection of runtime threats in containerized environments, such as configuration errors and malicious activities, to ensure the compliance and resilience of dynamic microservices architectures. It is crucial in Kubernetes clusters and multi-cloud deployments to prevent data breaches and meet audit requirements.

Core tools feature real-time vulnerability scanning, behavioral analysis, and policy enforcement capabilities, integrated with CI/CD to implement ""shift-left"" security. For example, they cover image scanning, network policy monitoring, and anomaly detection, automate vulnerability responses, reduce the attack surface, improve the efficiency of security teams, and accelerate application delivery.

Recommended tools include Aqua Security (full lifecycle protection), Sysdig Secure (runtime security and forensics), Prisma Cloud (multi-cloud coverage), and the open-source solution Falco (customized threat detection). These tools reduce security risks and optimize compliance costs through centralized visual management.
