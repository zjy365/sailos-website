Cloud-native environments are built on containerization, microservices, and cloud infrastructure, providing elasticity and automation capabilities. Managing multiple development environments (such as development, testing, and production) is crucial as it ensures environmental consistency, reduces configuration drift, and supports agile iteration and continuous delivery. Key application scenarios include parallel development by multiple teams and DevOps processes, which significantly improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Core components include container technologies (e.g., Docker) for environmental portability, and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes namespaces) for isolation and multi-tenancy support. Through Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD automation, environment definition, creation, and destruction are simplified. In practical applications, it accelerates environment reuse, supports rapid test deployment, reduces human errors, and enhances cross-environment compatibility.

Implementation steps: 1. Standardize container images to define environment baselines. 2. Use orchestration tools to manage multiple isolated environment instances. 3. Integrate automated pipelines for deployment and monitoring. Business values include shortening development cycles by 50%, reducing configuration management costs by 30%, and increasing release frequency and reliability.
