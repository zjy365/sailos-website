  "content": "Hybrid cloud systems integrate public and private cloud resources, and managing API calls between services is crucial. It ensures efficient cross-cloud interoperability, security, and elasticity, applied in integration scenarios such as data synchronization and load balancing.\n\nCore components include an API gateway (e.g., Apigee) as a unified entry point, and a service mesh to handle microservice communication. Features涵盖身份验证 (OAuth), monitoring, and logging. In practical applications, it enhances reliability, reduces latency, simplifies multi-cloud workflows, and improves system performance and compliance.\n\nImplementation steps: Deploy API management tools; configure security mechanisms (e.g., API key policies); set up monitoring and logging systems. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud storage access, and the business value lies in optimizing costs, improving resilience, and reducing risks."
