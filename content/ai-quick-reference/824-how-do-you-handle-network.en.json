  "content": "Cloud-native applications utilize container and microservice architectures. Cybersecurity issues involve protecting inter-service communication and data to prevent unauthorized access, vulnerability exploitation, and data leakage. Its importance lies in ensuring the integrity, high availability, and compliance of distributed systems, which are widely used in Kubernetes and multi-cloud environments.\n\nThe core components include network policy definitions (such as Kubernetes Network Policies), service meshes (such as Istio or Linkerd), and identity authentication mechanisms. Features include the zero-trust model, dynamic encryption, and micro-segmentation, with principles based on policy-driven and automation. In practical applications, service meshes provide automatic mTLS and authorization policies, ensuring secure communication between services, significantly enhancing defense capabilities, and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR.\n\nImplementation steps: First, define and deploy Kubernetes Network Policies to limit the scope of Pod communication; second, integrate service meshes to enable automatic mTLS and traffic control; third, combine security tools such as Falco for real-time monitoring. A typical scenario is an e-commerce microservice architecture, with business values including reducing the attack surface, minimizing operational risks, and ensuring business continuity."
