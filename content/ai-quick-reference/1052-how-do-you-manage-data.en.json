  "content": "Managing data storage across multiple cloud service providers refers to controlling data storage in a multi-cloud environment (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) using unified policies to avoid vendor lock-in, enhance flexibility and disaster recovery capabilities. Its importance lies in optimizing costs, strengthening business continuity, and meeting compliance requirements. Application scenarios include global data access, hybrid cloud deployment, and disaster recovery planning.\n\nThe core components of this concept include a data abstraction layer (e.g., S3-compatible interface), metadata management, and a policy engine. Features cover data consistency, location transparency, and automated synchronization. The principle involves API integration and virtualization technology. Practical applications improve high availability through unified monitoring, with the impact of reducing vendor risks, such as distributed data lakes achieving load balancing and elastic scaling.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy multi-cloud storage management tools (e.g., MinIO or Velero); 2. Standardize access protocols; 3. Set up cross-cloud data replication and backup; 4. Monitor performance and costs. Typical scenarios include cross-regional disaster recovery and hybrid cloud expansion. Business values include cost optimization, agile migration, and compliance support, enhancing overall resilience."
