In cloud-native applications, zero-trust security is an advanced security model that abandons traditional network boundary trust and requires continuous verification of all access. Its importance lies in the highly dynamic nature of cloud-native environments, where traditional firewalls cannot adapt to microservice interactions and prevent both internal and external threats. Application scenarios include microservice communication in Kubernetes clusters and ensuring transaction security in financial data platforms, for example.

Core components include identity authentication (such as OIDC or JWT), micro-segmentation network policies (implemented through service meshes like Istio), least privilege access control, and continuous monitoring. The principle is ""never trust, always verify,"" with authorization based on identity rather than IP address. In practical applications, policies can be configured at the API gateway to intercept requests, and access control can be strengthened through tools like SPIFFE identities. Its impact significantly enhances data protection, reduces the attack surface, supports compliance requirements such as GDPR, and promotes resilient business growth.

Implementation steps: First, assess application assets and risks; second, deploy identity services (such as Keycloak) and service meshes; third, configure role-based access policies; finally, enable auditing and log monitoring. A typical scenario is implementing zero-trust isolation for microservices when e-commerce platforms process user payments. Business values include reducing the risk of data breaches, improving operational agility and customer trust, and ultimately driving innovation.
