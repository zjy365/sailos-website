  "content": "Microservices architecture splits monolithic applications into fine-grained services that can be independently deployed and managed. This feature significantly enhances scalability and flexibility, enabling applications to adapt to load changes more precisely and efficiently, making it a core solution for supporting high concurrency and rapid iteration in cloud-native scenarios.\n\nThe core of microservices lies in autonomy. Each service has its own dedicated database and technology stack, and can communicate through decoupled APIs. This enables precise control over horizontal scaling: only high-load services (such as user authentication services) need to be scaled individually, rather than the entire application. The impact of failures is also locally isolated, greatly enhancing the overall resilience of the system.\n\nIn implementation, service boundaries are first divided according to business functions. Through containerized deployment and Kubernetes orchestration, dynamic and automatic scaling of service instances and load balancing can be achieved. The business value lies in resource optimization (matching different resources for CPU-intensive or IO-intensive services), improved response speed (independent scaling of high-frequency modules), and cost savings (avoiding redundancy from overall scaling)."
