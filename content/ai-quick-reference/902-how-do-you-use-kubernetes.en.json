  "content": "Kubernetes secret management involves the secure handling of sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or certificates, which is crucial in containerized environments to protect confidential information from unauthorized access. Its core application scenarios include deploying database-driven applications, ensuring secure transmission and storage of credentials within the cluster.\n\nThe core component is the Secrets resource, which consists of key-value pairs and supports RBAC access control; features include optional encryption (e.g., etcd encryption) to enhance security. In practical applications, Secrets are injected into Pods via environment variables or file volumes, eliminating the risk of hardcoding, facilitating automated management of cloud-native configurations, and reducing the potential for data breaches.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Create a Secret object (kubectl create secret or YAML manifest). 2. Reference the Secret as env or volumes in the Pod definition. Typical scenarios include microservices accessing external APIs; business values are enhancing security compliance, simplifying operations and maintenance, and accelerating the secure development lifecycle."
