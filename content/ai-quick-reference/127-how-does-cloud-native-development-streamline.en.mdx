Cloud-native development leverages key technologies such as containerization and microservices to simplify deployment. It packages applications and their dependencies into standard container images to achieve environmental consistency, and improves deployment efficiency through declarative infrastructure management, which is crucial in agile scenarios with frequent releases.

Its core lies in container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) automating deployment, scaling, and operations. Kubernetes defines the desired state of applications through declarative configurations (YAML) and continuously monitors and maintains that state. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures environment reproducibility. The microservices architecture allows independent deployment of each service, reducing the risk of changes and increasing overall iteration speed.

Development teams define application deployment specifications by writing declarative manifests. Combined with CI/CD pipelines, after a new version of the image is built, the system automatically executes strategies such as rolling updates or blue-green deployments in the Kubernetes cluster to achieve zero-downtime releases. This significantly shortens delivery cycles, improves system reliability, and enhances resource utilization.
