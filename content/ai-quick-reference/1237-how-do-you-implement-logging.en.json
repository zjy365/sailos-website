  "content": "In CI/CD pipelines, logging and tracing ensure the visibility and reliability of software delivery by collecting system events and tracking request flows, improving troubleshooting efficiency and supporting compliance audits, often used to debug build failures and optimize deployment processes.\n\nThe core includes defining structured log formats (such as JSON), integrating ELK stack or cloud services for log aggregation, and implementing distributed tracing tools (such as Jaeger or OpenTelemetry). These components operate through event correlation and visual analysis pipelines, strengthening DevOps automation, shortening feedback cycles, and reducing delivery risks.\n\nConfigure log export by integrating CI/CD tools (such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions), embed code using tracing SDKs, and deploy middleware. Typical scenarios involve monitoring pipeline execution to quickly identify bottlenecks. The business value is to enhance system reliability and audit capabilities, and reduce downtime."
