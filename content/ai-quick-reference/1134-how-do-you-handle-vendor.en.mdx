In a multi-cloud strategy, the issue of vendor lock-in refers to enterprises being overly dependent on a single cloud provider, resulting in high costs for migration or replacement. Its importance lies in avoiding lock-in to enhance business resilience, optimize costs, and support critical scenarios such as cross-cloud load balancing and disaster recovery.

The core approach to address this is to build abstraction layers and standard interfaces, such as utilizing containerization (Docker) and Kubernetes orchestration to achieve workload portability. Features include the adoption of multi-cloud management platforms for unified monitoring and deployment, with practical applications like seamlessly migrating applications between AWS, Azure, or GCP through Kubernetes, significantly reducing dependency risks.

Implementation steps include adopting common services, deploying containerized applications on Kubernetes clusters, and integrating tools like Istio; typical scenarios involve multi-region application deployment to ensure high availability. Business value brings cost savings, flexible scalability, and accelerated innovation.
