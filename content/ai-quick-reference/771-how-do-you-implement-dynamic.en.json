  "content": "Dynamic data expansion refers to a mechanism in cloud-native environments that automatically adjusts storage capacity based on demand. Its importance lies in ensuring elastic resource supply and continuous availability, preventing application disruptions caused by insufficient capacity. Typical applications include scenarios such as microservice databases and real-time data processing, adapting to fluctuations in business loads.\n\nThe core components include Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV/PVC), Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers, and cloud service integration. The principle involves defining automatic expansion policies through storage classes to achieve non-disruptive capacity expansion. In practical applications, it supports horizontal scaling of stateful services, improving resource efficiency, reducing operational costs, and promoting agile data management.\n\nImplementation steps: Configure storage classes to enable dynamic expansion policies; set initial capacity and expansion thresholds in PVC definitions; integrate CSI drivers or cloud-native storage services for automatic execution; set up monitoring to trigger adjustments. A typical scenario is database cluster expansion, with business values including automated operations, higher availability, and scalability."
