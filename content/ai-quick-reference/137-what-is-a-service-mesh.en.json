  "content": "A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for managing communication between microservices, providing observability, reliability, and security without modifying application code. Its importance lies in decoupling network functions from application logic, simplifying the management of distributed systems in cloud-native environments, such as implementing microservice architectures and cloud-native applications. Application scenarios include service discovery, traffic control, and fault recovery.\n\nA service mesh consists of a data plane (e.g., Envoy proxies) and a control plane (e.g., Istio), with core features including load balancing for inter-service communication, encryption (mTLS), distributed tracing, and circuit breaking mechanisms. In cloud-native environments, it uniformly enforces security policies and scalable monitoring, significantly improving operational efficiency, system resilience, and supporting zero-trust architecture and real-time fault diagnosis.\n\nWhen adapting to cloud-native environments, service meshes deploy sidecar proxies by integrating with platforms like Kubernetes, enabling automated service discovery and dynamic configuration. Typical implementation steps include defining mesh policies and injecting proxies, delivering business values such as simplified deployment, enhanced observability, reduced application complexity, ultimately accelerating innovation and ensuring high availability."
