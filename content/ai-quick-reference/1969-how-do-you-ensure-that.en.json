  "content": "Cloud-native applications need to be highly modular and scalable to adapt to dynamic cloud computing environments. Modularity decomposes applications into independent microservices, improving development efficiency; scalability enables automatic adjustment of elastic resources to support traffic peaks such as e-commerce promotions, ensuring efficient resource utilization and business continuity.\n\nThe core components include microservices architecture, containerization (e.g., Docker), and Kubernetes orchestration. Microservices decouple modules for independent updates; containers encapsulate environments to ensure consistency; Kubernetes enables automatic deployment and horizontal scaling. Practical applications such as financial services handling high-concurrency transactions significantly improve system reliability and agility.\n\nImplementation steps: Design microservice boundaries for loose coupling; use containers to encapsulate application components; deploy to Kubernetes clusters and configure HPA for automatic scaling. Typical scenarios include elastic resource expansion during sudden user growth; business values are reduced operational costs, enhanced fault tolerance, and accelerated iterative innovation."
