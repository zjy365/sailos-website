CI/CD pipeline systems automate software building, testing, and deployment processes. High availability ensures their continuous operation during failures, reducing downtime risks and ensuring rapid delivery. This is crucial for cloud-native environments, supporting DevOps teams in achieving zero-downtime deployments and resilient application releases.

Core components include redundant service deployment, load balancing, automatic failover, and status monitoring. Features such as distributed architecture and containerized orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) ensure fault tolerance. In practical applications, integrating cloud platform services enhances reliability, with impacts including reduced deployment latency and improved system resilience.

Implementation steps: 1. Use Kubernetes to orchestrate containerized workloads for automatic scaling. 2. Deploy load balancers and service meshes (e.g., Istio) to distribute traffic. 3. Configure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) for real-time alerts. 4. Regularly test backup and disaster recovery plans. Typical business values include increased deployment frequency, reduced failure costs, and support for business continuity.
