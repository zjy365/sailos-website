In cloud-native Kubernetes clusters, network security refers to protecting communication and data interaction between containers to prevent unauthorized access and threats. It is crucial for ensuring data privacy, compliance (such as GDPR) in microservice environments, and is applied in distributed application deployment scenarios like cloud-based DevOps.

Core components include network policies (e.g., Kubernetes NetworkPolicies) that define ingress/egress rules, service meshes (e.g., Istio) that provide traffic encryption and authentication, as well as Pod security contexts and API gateways. These features implement traffic isolation and zero-trust models, and practical applications can enhance the security posture, reducing the risks of internal attacks and data breaches.

When addressing network security, prioritize defining NetworkPolicies to restrict Pod traffic; deploy service meshes to automatically encrypt communication; implement RBAC for access control; and integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus to detect anomalies. Typical scenarios include the launch of secure microservices, bringing business values such as reducing the attack surface, ensuring business continuity, and compliance adherence.
