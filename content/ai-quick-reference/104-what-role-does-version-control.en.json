  "content": "Version control systems (such as Git) manage the history of file changes and are crucial in cloud-native development. They support collaboration, change tracking, and traceability, applied to code and configuration management (such as Kubernetes YAML files), ensuring the agility and reliability of microservice architectures.\n\nCore components include commit, branch, and merge mechanisms, featuring distributed storage and atomic operations. Practical applications include Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Helm charts management, significantly improving deployment consistency and rollback capabilities, with impacts including reduced errors and increased speed of development iterations.\n\nApplications cover GitOps patterns to automate deployment processes, with value in enhancing environmental consistency, accelerating release cycles, and supporting reliable observability and audit compliance."
