Observability is a key concept for monitoring and diagnostic capabilities in cloud-native systems, including logs, metrics, and traces, to understand system status in real time. Integration into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is crucial as it ensures software quality and reliability, applicable to microservices architectures and DevOps practices, enhancing fault response and user experience.

Core components include logging, performance metrics collection, and distributed tracing tools such as Prometheus and Jaeger, enabling problem diagnosis through automated data collection. When applied in the SDLC, observability code is embedded during the development phase, metric anomalies are verified during testing, and trends are analyzed during operations. This integration impacts cross-team collaboration, shortening MTTR and optimizing system performance through continuous feedback.

Implementation steps include: 1. Planning observability goals during the requirements phase; 2. Embedding logging/metrics tools during development; 3. Adding automated monitoring tests in CI/CD pipelines; 4. Using dashboards for real-time analysis after deployment; 5. Conducting retrospectives and iterative improvements. Typical scenarios include rapid fault localization, with business value lying in improving system stability, reducing downtime costs, and accelerating delivery cycles.
