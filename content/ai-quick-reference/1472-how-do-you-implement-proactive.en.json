  "content": "Active monitoring is a preventive approach used to collect and analyze health data of cloud-native applications in real time. In cloud-native environments, its importance lies in ensuring high availability, elasticity, and performance stability of applications, especially in Kubernetes clusters or microservice architectures, where it can prevent service disruptions and support continuous delivery scenarios.\n\nThe core components include metric monitoring, log aggregation, distributed tracing, and alert mechanisms, characterized by real-time observability and automated data collection. For example, integrating monitoring in the Prometheus tool enables dynamic tracking of container resource utilization and request latency, thereby improving operational efficiency, reducing MTTR (Mean Time to Repair), and enhancing the agility of DevOps practices.\n\nImplementation steps: First, deploy monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana; second, configure application metrics and log collection; third, set alert thresholds based on anomaly detection; finally, integrate distributed tracing services such as Jaeger. A typical scenario is monitoring CPU/memory fluctuations of Kubernetes Pods to ensure business continuity, and its value lies in improving SLA, reducing downtime risks, and optimizing operational costs."
