  "content": "In cloud-native applications, SQL injection allows attackers to execute malicious database queries, while XSS involves injecting and executing malicious scripts. These vulnerabilities can easily lead to data breaches or system damage, and protection is crucial for compliance and data security, especially in microservices and containerized deployments.\n\nThe core of protection includes input validation to filter malicious inputs, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, output encoding and content security policies to block XSS. Implement layered defense by combining service mesh, API gateway policies and Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and enhance secure isolation of inter-container communication through Kubernetes network policies to effectively reduce the attack surface.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Apply strict validation mechanisms to all user inputs. 2. Use prepared statements or ORM for database access. 3. Encode dynamic content before output and configure the HTTPOnly flag. 4. Deploy WAF and integrate security scanning tools. This process reduces risks, improves business compliance, protects sensitive data and maintains customer trust."
