Cloud-native environments are based on containerization and microservice architectures, leveraging dynamic orchestration technology to achieve elastic resource scheduling. Supporting multi-tenancy allows multiple independent users or organizations to share cloud resources while ensuring isolation, thereby improving resource utilization and reducing operational costs, which is widely applied in SaaS platforms and cloud service delivery scenarios.

Core components include Kubernetes namespaces for tenant resource isolation, RBAC for access control, network policies such as Calico to ensure communication security, and resource quotas to limit CPU and memory consumption. By logically isolating and sharing the underlying infrastructure, this mechanism optimizes resource allocation and management efficiency in cloud services, facilitating enterprise agile scaling and data compliance.

Implementation steps:划分 tenants using namespaces, apply RBAC to define roles, configure resource quotas, deploy network policies, and integrate service meshes such as Istio for traffic governance. Typical scenarios include SaaS application platforms, and business values are reflected in enhanced security isolation, reduced operational complexity, improved service scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
