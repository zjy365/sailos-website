  "content": "Cloud-native applications are built on containers and microservices, requiring elastic and scalable data access. Distributed databases provide high availability, fault tolerance, and performance by distributing data across multiple nodes, which is crucial for scenarios handling large-scale transactions such as e-commerce or real-time analytics.\n\nCore components include data sharding, replication, and consistency models (e.g., the CAP theorem). Features involve automatic failover, geographic distribution, and horizontal scaling. In practical applications, deploying Cassandra or CockroachDB instances through Kubernetes platforms (such as StatefulSets or Operators) enables seamless scaling and disaster recovery, enhancing application resilience and responsiveness.\n\nThe steps are as follows: evaluate requirements to select a database; containerize the application; deploy an Operator on Kubernetes to manage the cluster; configure automatic backups, monitoring, and version management. Typical scenarios include data processing for global user platforms. Business values include improved high availability with 99.99% uptime, reduced latency, and lower operational costs."
