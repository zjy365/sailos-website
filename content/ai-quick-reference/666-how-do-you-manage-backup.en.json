  "content": "Cloud-native databases leverage the elasticity and scalability provided by cloud platforms to operate in distributed environments. Backup and disaster recovery strategies are crucial for ensuring data persistence and business continuity, applicable to high-availability scenarios such as real-time transaction systems, preventing data loss or service disruptions.\n\nThe core of the strategy includes regular snapshots, incremental backups, and remote replication, combined with Kubernetes operators or cloud service APIs to achieve automated execution. In practical applications, tools like AWS RDS's point-in-time recovery or Velero are used for non-disruptive backups, and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) are monitored to optimize the reliability and compliance of cloud-native environments.\n\nImplementation steps are: define RPO/RTO metrics; use automated tools to set up scheduled backups; regularly test recovery processes; monitor alert systems. Business values include minimizing data loss, ensuring 24/7 availability, and reducing operational risks caused by disaster events."
