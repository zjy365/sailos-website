  "content": "Cloud-native applications are designed based on cloud computing characteristics, such as containerization and microservice architecture. Optimizing rapid deployment is crucial, supporting agile development and continuous delivery, and they are widely used in scenarios with frequent iterations or high concurrency, such as e-commerce and financial systems.\n\nCore components include container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), automated CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code. Features include scalable deployment and elastic scaling. In practical applications, automation improves deployment speed, reduces manual intervention, promotes DevOps efficiency, and enhances system reliability.\n\nImplementation steps: automated configuration management (e.g., Terraform), integrating CI/CD to achieve continuous testing and deployment, and optimizing Kubernetes cluster scheduling. A typical scenario is microservice application deployment, which brings business values including shortening release cycles, reducing operation and maintenance costs, and improving elastic response capabilities."
