  "content": "Configuring a cloud-native environment on a multi-cloud platform requires integrating multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) and cloud-native technologies (such as containers, Kubernetes) to ensure application portability and elasticity. This is crucial for avoiding vendor lock-in, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities, and optimizing costs, and is commonly seen in enterprises deploying microservices across clouds to meet compliance or high availability requirements.\n\nCore components include multi-cluster Kubernetes management (via tools like Kubefed or Anthos), containerized applications, service meshes (such as Istio), and automated CI/CD pipelines. Features are based on standardized interfaces and infrastructure-as-code principles to ensure unified orchestration, with practical impacts including enhanced application reliability, scalability, and cross-cloud resource utilization efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Design a multi-cloud architecture, select cloud providers, and configure management tools. 2. Deploy Kubernetes clusters and coordinate cross-cloud resources. 3. Build container images and integrate service meshes. 4. Automate CI/CD testing and deployment. A typical scenario is enterprises distributing applications to prevent single points of failure; business values include reducing operational costs, improving scalability, and enhancing business continuity."
