  "content": "Data partitioning is the process of dividing large datasets into smaller, logically independent units for data management and access. It is crucial in cloud-native applications as it enhances scalability, reliability, and performance, supporting distributed systems such as microservice architectures and cloud databases (e.g., Cassandra or Kafka) to ensure efficient handling of large-scale workloads.\n\nKey components include partition keys (such as user IDs or timestamps) and strategies (such as hash or range partitioning) to achieve uniform data distribution. It reduces bottlenecks, improves load balancing, and accelerates queries by processing multiple partitions in parallel; in elastic scaling scenarios, nodes handle data independently, reducing latency and avoiding single points of failure, thereby significantly optimizing the response speed and resource utilization of cloud-native systems.\n\nThe application of data partitioning enables efficient data operations in cloud-native environments, with its value lying in accelerating processing throughput, supporting dynamic scaling (e.g., automatic node addition), and enhancing fault tolerance, ultimately improving application performance and user experience."
