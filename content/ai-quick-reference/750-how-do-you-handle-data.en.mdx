Cloud-native data access control ensures that applications only access authorized data resources through fine-grained permission management, which is crucial for meeting compliance requirements and preventing data leaks in dynamic microservice environments.

Its core mechanisms include service identity-based (rather than IP-based) authentication (e.g., SPIFFE/SPIRE), policy-driven authorization models (RBAC/ABAC), service mesh network layer policies, and secret management tools. Data encryption (in transit/at rest) and tokenization technologies implement defense in depth. Policy engines such as OPA support declarative policy as code.

Implementation steps are: 1) Establish a unified identity source (e.g., OIDC); 2) Configure RBAC in Kubernetes to restrict Pod access permissions; 3) Define cross-service data access policies through OPA; 4) Enable mTLS and traffic policies in the service mesh; 5) Manage sensitive data credentials using tools like Vault. This solution implements secure and compliant data governance in scenarios such as financial transaction systems and multi-tenant SaaS.
