Cache strategy optimizes data access by storing frequently requested data for quick responses. It is crucial in cloud-native applications, improving performance, reducing latency, and lowering cloud costs, suitable for microservices and high-concurrency scenarios such as e-commerce and real-time analytics.

Core components include in-memory caches (e.g., Redis), distributed storage, and consistency models. Features involve timeliness (e.g., TTL settings) and caching patterns (e.g., cache-aside). In practical applications, it supports scalability, reduces database load, and enhances high availability.

Implementation steps: First, evaluate requirements to select a caching service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache); second, integrate it into the application, such as using client libraries to add caching logic; then define strategies, such as setting TTL and monitoring hit rates; finally, monitor and adjust to ensure business value, such as improving user experience and reducing costs.
