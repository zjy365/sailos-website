Automated unit testing checks the functional correctness of individual code units in software development to ensure code quality; CI/CD pipelines are automated processes for continuous integration and deployment, used to quickly build, test, and deploy code, improving delivery efficiency and reliability. Their importance lies in reducing manual testing overhead, capturing defects early, and being applied in agile development and microservice scenarios, such as preventing production environment failures.

The core of implementation includes integrating unit testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, PyTest) into CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions), and defining test tasks through configuration files: automatically triggering tests after each code commit, checking coverage, and handling dependencies. In practical applications, test failures will interrupt the pipeline to prevent incorrect deployments, significantly improving code reliability and team response speed, thereby accelerating the iteration cycle.

Implementation steps: 1. Write and maintain unit test suites. 2. Configure trigger rules and test run scripts in CI/CD tools. 3. Process results - proceed with deployment if successful, send alerts and block the process if failed. Typical scenarios include automatically verifying new code after merge requests. Business values include reducing defect rates by over 50%, shortening release time, and improving customer satisfaction.
