Integrating monitoring tools into the CI/CD pipeline refers to introducing runtime monitoring data of applications and infrastructure into the deployment process, enabling a closed-loop feedback of ""Build-Measure-Learn"". It is crucial for ensuring deployment quality, quickly identifying and fixing issues, and has core value especially in scenarios of automated delivery and progressive deployment in production environments.

Integration typically involves three key steps:

1. Injecting monitoring configurations during the deployment phase: CI/CD tools automatically configure log collectors, monitoring agents, or metric exporters when deploying applications, ensuring that observability of the new version takes effect immediately.

2. Defining quality verification gates: Setting up automated testing steps in the post-deployment phase, calling monitoring APIs to verify key metrics (such as error rates, latency), comparing with preset baselines/SLOs, and triggering alarms or automatic rollbacks if they do not meet the requirements.

3. Establishing a feedback-driven process: Associating monitoring alarms with ticketing systems, where key events automatically trigger the pipeline to re-run the repair process; at the same time, visualizing monitoring data to provide the team with deployment effect reports.

This integration brings significant business value: by detecting deployment failures in real-time, MTTR is greatly shortened; using automated SLO verification to improve release quality; monitoring data-driven rollback decisions to reduce risks; and ultimately achieving a true closed-loop of continuous improvement. Typical scenarios include traffic switching verification for blue-green deployments and progressive metric evaluation for Canary releases.
