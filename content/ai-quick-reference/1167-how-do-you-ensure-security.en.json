  "content": "Ensuring the security of hybrid cloud applications requires implementing consistent security policies across public cloud, private cloud, and on-premises environments, aiming to protect data, workloads, and infrastructure. Its importance lies in the fact that the complexity of hybrid environments increases the attack surface, with potential risks including data breaches and non-compliance. This security requirement is widely applied in industries such as finance and healthcare that need strict data control while leveraging cloud scalability.\n\nThe core components include: unified Identity and Access Management (IAM) for granular control of user permissions across environments; comprehensive data encryption covering data in transit and at rest; strict network segmentation and micro-segmentation to limit lateral movement of potential threats; continuous security monitoring and automated compliance auditing covering all components; and centralized log management and threat analysis for rapid detection and response to incidents. These components form a defense-in-depth system.\n\nImplementation steps are: implementing strong identity authentication (such as MFA) and least privilege IAM policies; applying encryption throughout the process using cloud provider KMS or own keys; establishing a zero-trust network model with software-defined perimeters and firewalls; uniformly collecting and analyzing logs and events from all environments; and automating configuration checks and compliance scans. This approach can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, meet regulatory requirements (such as GDPR, HIPAA), and ensure business continuity."
