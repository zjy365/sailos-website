  "content": "Distributed applications running in cross-cloud environments require cross-cloud CI/CD to achieve automated building, testing, and deployment, thereby improving development efficiency, ensuring consistency, and supporting multi-cloud strategies. Application scenarios include high-availability financial services or globally scaled systems.\n\nThe core components include containerization (e.g., Docker), infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform), and CI/CD pipeline tools (e.g., GitLab CI), characterized by automation and GitOps principles. In practical applications, multi-point deployment to AWS or Azure is implemented to accelerate delivery cycles and enhance disaster recovery capabilities.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Unify source code and configuration management, 2. Automate building and cross-cloud testing, 3. Containerize deployment to Kubernetes clusters, 4. Continuously monitor and optimize. Business values include reducing cloud lock-in risks, accelerating time-to-market, and optimizing costs."
