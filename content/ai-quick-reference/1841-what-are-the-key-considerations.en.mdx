Choosing a cloud service provider is a critical decision in cloud-native application development, ensuring that applications achieve high elasticity, scalability, and agile deployment based on containers and microservices. This decision is crucial as it enhances development efficiency, reduces cost risks, and supports rapid iteration and global expansion scenarios such as automated CI/CD pipelines.

Key considerations include platform reliability (e.g., SLA guarantees), cost-effectiveness (e.g., on-demand pricing models), tool integration (e.g., support for Kubernetes and DevOps ecosystems), security (including data encryption and compliance certifications), and global infrastructure coverage. These features directly impact application development and operations by simplifying deployment processes, enhancing fault tolerance, and optimizing resource utilization, thereby improving business continuity and innovation speed.

The application value of these factors lies in evaluating providers to match requirements, optimizing application performance, risk control, and cost efficiency, thereby driving business growth and market competitiveness.
