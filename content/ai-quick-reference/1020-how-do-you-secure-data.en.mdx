Protecting data security during data transmission between different cloud environments involves ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data when it moves in cross-cloud migrations or hybrid cloud architectures. This is crucial for preventing data breaches and meeting compliance requirements (such as GDPR), and is commonly seen in backup, data synchronization, and application deployment scenarios within multi-cloud strategies.

The core methods are adopting encrypted transmission protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL), identity authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication), and dedicated channels (e.g., VPN or cloud service private connections like AWS Direct Connect). These technologies defend against eavesdropping and tampering by encrypting data, verifying endpoints, and isolating traffic, and are applied in cloud data migration and API communication to enhance the overall security posture.

Implementation steps include: configuring transport layer encryption protocols, establishing VPN or cloud private links, enabling strong identity authentication, and deploying continuous monitoring tools. Typical scenarios include cross-cloud backup or application integration. Business values include reducing the risk of data breaches, enhancing regulatory compliance, and supporting efficient cloud operations.
