Cloud-native applications leverage containerization and microservices architecture to achieve agile deployment and elastic scaling. Auditing such applications to verify security standards like CIS or NIST frameworks is crucial to prevent data breaches, ensure regulatory compliance, and is widely applied in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare.

The core of auditing includes reviewing configuration management (e.g., Kubernetes policy enforcement), runtime monitoring (using tools like Falco), and image security scanning. Its characteristics emphasize automation, policy-as-code implementation, and optimizing security posture through CI/CD integration to reduce vulnerabilities and attack surfaces, thereby enhancing system reliability.

Implementation steps: 1. Identify applicable security standard baselines. 2. Deploy auditing tools (e.g., kube-bench or OPA). 3. Integrate continuous monitoring and alerting mechanisms. 4. Regularly assess and remediate vulnerabilities. A typical scenario is the DevSecOps process, where business value is reflected in simplified compliance, reduced operational risks, and enhanced trust.
