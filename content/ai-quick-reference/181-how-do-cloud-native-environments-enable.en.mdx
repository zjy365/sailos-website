Cloud-native environments utilize containerization and microservices architectures to achieve elastic scaling and automated deployment of applications. Their importance lies in supporting agile development and cloud-scale expansion, applied in platforms like Kubernetes to simplify release processes and enhance system reliability.

Core components include container orchestration systems (such as Kubernetes), declarative configurations, and automation tools. By defining resources like Pods and Deployments, applications can be quickly deployed and horizontally scaled, reducing manual intervention. In practical applications, K8s clusters manage replicas and services, enabling zero-downtime updates and significantly improving scalability and fault tolerance.

Implementation steps: containerize the application, write K8s YAML manifest deployment configurations, and set up horizontal auto-scalers. Typical scenarios involve integrating with CI/CD pipelines for releasing updates, with business values including accelerated iteration, reduced resource costs, and support for dynamic scaling.
