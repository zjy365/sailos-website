  "content": "Cloud-native applications run in container and microservices architectures and are vulnerable to external threats such as DDoS or data breaches. Security protection is crucial to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of applications, which are widely used in public cloud deployments and multi-tenant environments to maintain business continuity.\n\nCore mechanisms include identity authentication (e.g., RBAC), encrypted transmission (TLS), network security policies (e.g., Kubernetes network isolation), and vulnerability scanning (static analysis). The zero-trust principle requires verifying all access. In practice, API gateways are used to prevent attacks such as SQL injection, significantly reducing risks and enhancing compliance.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Apply the zero-trust model and verify all identities. 2. Configure network policies to restrict traffic. 3. Integrate automated scanning into CI/CD pipelines to monitor threats. Business values include reducing downtime losses, ensuring data security, and enhancing customer trust."
