The observability stack is a collection of tools used for monitoring, diagnosing, and optimizing distributed systems in cloud-native environments. It is crucial for ensuring high availability, rapid troubleshooting, and performance analysis, and is widely applied in operational monitoring, service debugging, and capacity planning.

Core components include log management systems (such as the EFK stack) for recording application events, metrics collectors (such as Prometheus) for gathering performance data, distributed tracing tools (such as Jaeger) for tracking request paths, as well as alerting mechanisms and visualization dashboards (such as Grafana). Through real-time data collection and correlational analysis, these elements enhance system visibility, with impacts including improved operational efficiency, reduced downtime, and support for DevOps processes.

Its application value lies in providing end-to-end observability, facilitating rapid fault localization, resource optimization, and user experience improvement, thereby enhancing service reliability and business continuity.
