Microservices architecture enhances application resilience by decomposing monolithic applications into small, independent services. Each service拥有 exclusive resources and processes, ensuring that the failure of a single component does not cause the entire system to crash. This is crucial in scenarios with strict high-availability requirements such as e-commerce and financial transactions, guaranteeing the continuity of critical business processes.

The core principles lie in service isolation and loose coupling: failures are localized and their spread is limited through mechanisms like circuit breakers and retries. Auto-scaling capabilities dynamically adjust resources based on load to prevent cascading failures; service discovery and load balancing optimize traffic distribution. This distributed design reduces single points of risk and enhances the system's resilience to challenges such as hardware failures and traffic spikes.

During implementation, service boundaries need to be defined and independent containers (e.g., Kubernetes Pods) deployed, with elastic middleware like Hystrix integrated to enable circuit breaking and degradation. Combined with monitoring and alerting (e.g., Prometheus) and self-healing strategies (e.g., restarting failed instances), rapid failure recovery is achieved. Business values include improved availability (SLA of 99.95%+), reduced MTTR, and support for zero-downtime updates such as blue-green deployments.
