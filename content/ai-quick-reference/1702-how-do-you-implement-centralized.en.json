  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) uses code to automate the definition and management of infrastructure resources (such as servers or networks), ensuring configuration consistency and version control. Centralized management unifies resources under a single control point, reduces human errors through standard processes, and is suitable for cloud environments and enterprise multi-team collaboration scenarios, improving reliability and auditability.\n\nCore components include declarative code files (such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation), version control (e.g., Git), and CI/CD toolchains. The principle is that code defines the resource state, and the automation engine executes changes to achieve repeatable deployments. This can significantly improve efficiency, reduce configuration drift, and support compliance requirements, such as the unified implementation of security policies.\n\nImplementation steps: select tools and write infrastructure code; store it in a central repository (e.g., GitHub); integrate CI/CD processes for automatic validation and deployment. Typical scenarios include multi-environment management or disaster recovery, bringing business values such as cost savings, rapid iteration, and agile response to changes."
