Cloud-native development is based on containerization and microservices to build portable, elastically scalable cloud applications. Serverless architecture is its core practice, eliminating server management and enabling automatic scaling through event-driven mechanisms. Its importance lies in reducing operational costs, enhancing agility, and improving resource utilization, making it suitable for scenarios such as real-time API services and batch processing jobs.

The core components include Kubernetes orchestration, Function as a Service (e.g., AWS Lambda), and service mesh, with the principle of event-triggered on-demand computing. In practical applications, cloud-native tools like Knative integrate serverless capabilities, enabling zero-downtime deployment, accelerating innovation, reducing infrastructure overhead, and facilitating the flexible implementation of microservice architectures.

Implementation steps: First, deploy containerized applications to cloud platforms (such as AKS or EKS). Second, integrate serverless frameworks (such as Knative) to deploy function code. Third, establish CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and release. Typical scenarios include Webhook responses or data processing, with business values reflected in scalability, pay-as-you-go cost optimization, and rapid iteration to market.
