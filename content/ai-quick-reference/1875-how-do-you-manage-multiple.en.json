  "content": "Managing multiple versions of cloud-native applications involves controlling and deploying different iterations of applications using cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes. This is crucial in microservices architectures, supporting continuous deployment, A/B testing, and rapid rollbacks to ensure high availability and innovation efficiency.\n\nCore components include Kubernetes Deployments for rolling updates, service meshes like Istio for traffic routing, and Helm for versioned configurations. Practical applications are implemented through blue-green deployments and canary releases to reduce release risks and increase release frequency, such as gradually directing user traffic to new versions during updates.\n\nImplementation steps: Define version labels in Kubernetes deployments; configure CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment of new versions; use service selectors to route traffic for canary testing; monitor performance and set up rollback mechanisms. Business values include reduced downtime, accelerated iteration, and support for experiment-driven innovation."
