  "content": "Cloud-native applications are built on containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), involving microservices architecture. Their security is crucial in production environments to prevent data breaches, service disruptions, and compliance risks, especially in sectors like finance and e-commerce that support highly available businesses.\n\nCore security components include: container image scanning (vulnerability detection tools such as Trivy), network security (policies like Kubernetes network isolation), runtime protection (service meshes like Istio for traffic encryption), identity authentication (RBAC mechanisms), and log monitoring. These elements integrate to form a DevSecOps framework, ensuring end-to-end protection, enhancing system resilience, and reducing the attack surface.\n\nImplementation steps include: regularly scanning container images; configuring access controls such as RBAC; applying network policies to isolate Pod communication; deploying runtime monitoring tools; and automating security testing in CI/CD pipelines. Business values include enhanced compliance, reduced operational risks, optimized response times, and maintenance of customer trust."
