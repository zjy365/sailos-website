Cloud-native environments provide critical technical support for continuous delivery through containerization, microservices architecture, and declarative infrastructure management. Their core value lies in automating and standardizing application building, testing, and release processes, ensuring consistency across multiple environments, thereby significantly improving software delivery efficiency and reliability.

The core implementation relies on the immutability of container images to ensure environment uniformity; Kubernetes enables strategies such as rolling updates and blue-green deployments; and service meshes provide fine-grained traffic control. CI/CD pipelines automatically trigger image building and deployment, combined with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), to achieve full-process automation from development to production, supporting minute-level release frequencies.

Practical implementation includes: containerizing application packaging → establishing automated build pipelines → configuring Kubernetes deployment strategies → integrating monitoring and alerting. This model supports frequent releases (dozens of times a day), second-level rollback capabilities, greatly reduces deployment risks, shortens business iteration cycles from weekly to hourly, and significantly improves market response speed.
