Containerization packages applications and their dependencies into independent units, providing a standard execution environment in cloud-native development and ensuring consistency and efficiency in cross-platform application migration. Its importance lies in supporting microservice architectures and enabling elastic and scalable deployments, with application scenarios including continuous delivery processes and resource optimization in multi-cloud environments.

Core features include lightweight resource isolation, fast startup, and image-based management, based on the principle of operating system-level virtualization. In practical applications, it facilitates DevOps practices, such as automatic service orchestration through integration of container engines with Kubernetes, enhancing agile development capabilities and reducing infrastructure complexity, significantly impacting areas like hybrid cloud management and security compliance.

Application value includes simplifying the deployment lifecycle and improving resource utilization, directly bringing business benefits such as reduced运维成本 and accelerated innovation iteration time.
