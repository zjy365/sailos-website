  "content": "Observability refers to the ability to visualize and understand the internal behavior of a system, which is crucial in cloud-native development environments. Due to the wide distribution and dynamic nature of cloud-native applications such as microservices and containerized systems, observability enables real-time monitoring of faults, performance fluctuations, and dependencies, and is applied in continuous integration/delivery pipelines and resource optimization scenarios.\n\nThe core components include log collection, metric analysis, and distributed tracing, combined with tools like Prometheus and Jaeger. Features such as data aggregation and visualization principles help developers quickly locate code errors or bottlenecks. In practical applications, it improves system reliability and significantly impacts development iteration speed and operational efficiency, for example, optimizing service level agreements in Kubernetes clusters.\n\nIts role is to ensure high availability and fault tolerance by enhancing visibility, supporting rapid fault recovery and continuous optimization, thereby reducing downtime, improving user experience, and driving business values such as cost savings and accelerated innovation."
