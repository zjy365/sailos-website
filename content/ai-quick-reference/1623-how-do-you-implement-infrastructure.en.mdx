Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of automating infrastructure management using code, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency in multi-cloud environments involving multiple cloud providers such as AWS and Azure. Its importance lies in simplifying cross-cloud deployment, avoiding vendor lock-in, and supporting agile development and hybrid cloud scenarios.

The core components include declarative configuration files (e.g., Terraform's HCL), version control systems (Git), multi-cloud abstraction tools (e.g., Terraform provider), and CI/CD pipelines. The principle is to define the infrastructure state through code to achieve automated deployment and maintenance. In practical applications, it standardizes resource configuration, accelerates multi-cloud migration, reduces operational complexity, and promotes the scalability and security of cloud-native architectures.

Implementation steps: 1. Select multi-cloud compatible tools (e.g., Terraform). 2. Define unified configuration files to describe various cloud resources. 3. Integrate version control and CI/CD (e.g., Jenkins). 4. Test configurations in different cloud environments. 5. Automate deployment and monitoring. Business values include reducing human errors, optimizing costs, improving response speed, and driving continuous innovation.
