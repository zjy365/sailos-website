Kubernetes manages user permissions for cloud-native applications through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring authorized users access cluster resources. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized operations, protect data security, and meet compliance requirements, especially in multi-tenant microservice deployments such as applications in the financial or healthcare industries.

Core components include Roles (defining permissions within a namespace) and ClusterRoles (cluster-level permissions), which are assigned to users, groups, or ServiceAccounts via RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings. The principle is fine-grained authorization (e.g., read-only access to Pods), with practical applications supporting team isolation, enhanced security, and simplified operations. Impacts include reduced vulnerability risks and accelerated DevOps processes.

Implementation steps: 1. Create a Role to define permissions (such as verbs and resources). 2. Establish a Binding to associate the role with subjects (such as users or ServiceAccounts). 3. Test and iterate. A typical scenario is restricting development teams' access to production environments. Business values include enhanced security governance, reduced operational errors, and ensured regulatory compliance.
