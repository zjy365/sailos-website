  "content": "Ensuring container security in a multi-cloud environment refers to protecting containerized applications deployed across multiple cloud platforms from threats such as data breaches or unauthorized access. Its importance lies in preventing attacks, maintaining compliance, and supporting resilient cloud-native architectures, with wide applications in scenarios like DevOps pipelines and hybrid cloud deployments.\n\nCore components include container image vulnerability scanning, runtime behavior monitoring, network policy isolation, and unified Identity and Access Management (IAM). By integrating Kubernetes policy engines and cloud-native security platforms, consistent cross-cloud protection is achieved, enhancing system resilience and risk control capabilities, and reducing the attack surface in multi-cloud environments.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Assess multi-cloud architecture risks and define security policies; 2. Deploy automation tools such as image scanning and policy enforcement; 3. Implement continuous monitoring and auditing. Business values include reducing operational costs, enhancing threat response capabilities, ensuring service reliability and compliance."
