Monitoring data refers to metrics and logs collected from systems, applications, and services, such as CPU usage or error logs, used for real-time insight into performance health. Its importance lies in ensuring system reliability, early fault detection, and application in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes clusters or containerized platforms to prevent downtime. The management core includes data sampling, aggregation, and selective storage: configuring filtering rules, downsampling rates, and compressing old data through tools like Prometheus to avoid redundant metrics; in practice, setting data retention policies (e.g., retaining only 7 days of historical data), using labels to filter relevant metrics, and implementing alert threshold automation to reduce noise affecting analysis efficiency. Implementation steps are: 1. Define key business metrics such as latency or error rate; 2. Apply sampling mechanisms (e.g., Prometheus' scrape_interval); 3. Configure storage optimizations like tiered storage or data lifecycle management; 4. Integrate toolchains such as Elasticsearch and Grafana for automated analysis. Business value includes reducing storage costs by 20%-50%, improving monitoring accuracy, and accelerating problem response.
