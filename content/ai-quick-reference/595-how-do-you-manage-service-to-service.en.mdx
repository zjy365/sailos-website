Secure and efficient inter-service communication is key to microservices architecture, involving services exchanging data over networks. Its importance lies in protecting sensitive data from theft or tampering, while ensuring low-latency and high-throughput communication to maintain overall system performance and resilience—especially critical for high-security scenarios like finance and healthcare, and high-concurrency environments such as e-commerce.

Core components include: security mechanisms (mutual TLS authentication, transport encryption, service identity verification, fine-grained RBAC authorization policies, audit logging); efficiency strategies (service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, rate limiting, retry policies); and architectural patterns (e.g., decoupling via asynchronous message queues). Service meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) abstract communication logic into an infrastructure layer, transparently injecting security policies (automatic mTLS) and managing traffic through Sidecar proxies, significantly enhancing efficiency and controllability while enabling a zero-trust security model.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy the service mesh control plane and data plane (with automatic Sidecar injection); 2. Configure basic security policies (enforce mTLS, issue service certificates); 3. Define fine-grained authorization policies (identity-based access control); 4. Configure traffic management policies (load balancing algorithms, circuit breaking thresholds, rate limiting rules). Value: Reduces data breach risks, complies with regulations like GDPR, improves system availability (prevents cascading failures via circuit breaking), optimizes resource utilization, and reduces communication latency by over 20%.
