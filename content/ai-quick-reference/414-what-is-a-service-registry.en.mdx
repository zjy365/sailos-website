The service registry is a core component of the microservices architecture, used for dynamically managing the registration and discovery of service instances. It is crucial in microservices because the number of services is variable and their locations are uncertain, ensuring reliable communication and load balancing between services. Application scenarios include cloud-native systems and distributed environments, enhancing system elasticity and scalability.

The core components include a service registry, discovery interface, and health check mechanism. Features are high availability, fault tolerance, and automatic updates. The principle relies on distributed storage such as etcd. In practical applications, like Kubernetes' service mesh implementation, it simplifies operation and maintenance processes and significantly improves the robustness and operational efficiency of the microservices architecture.

Its application value is reflected in automated service routing and load balancing, reducing manual configuration overhead, enhancing system reliability and business high availability, and supporting seamless failover and efficient resource utilization.
