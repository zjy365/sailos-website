Large-scale testing of microservices is a process to verify the reliability of interactions between multiple independent services in a distributed architecture. Its importance lies in ensuring system stability and business continuity, and it is suitable for CI/CD pipeline deployment of cloud-native applications to reduce the risk of failures.

The core challenges include increased testing complexity due to difficulty in service isolation; dependency issues such as conflicts in inter-service calls leading to time-consuming setup of test environments; time-consuming and error-prone end-to-end testing involving coordination of multiple services; and difficulty in maintaining environmental consistency, which affects test accuracy. These challenges prolong the feedback cycle, hinder the efficiency of automated testing, and impact the agility of DevOps processes.

Addressing these challenges can shorten deployment time and improve service quality. The value lies in enhancing system resilience, supporting rapid business iterations, and achieving cost optimization and improved customer satisfaction by reducing downtime.
