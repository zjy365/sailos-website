  "content": "Cloud-native environments combine containerization and microservices architecture to efficiently process real-time data streams, with the key lying in low-latency processing and high scalability. Their importance lies in supporting instant analytical decision-making, applied in scenarios such as financial risk control and IoT monitoring.\n\nCore components include event-driven frameworks like Apache Kafka (message broker) and Apache Flink (stream processing engine), enabling elastic scaling, automatic failover, and resource isolation through Kubernetes. Features involve distributed computing and persistent storage. Practical applications increase throughput and reliability, significantly optimizing operational efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nImplementation steps: Select a stream processing framework (e.g., Flink), deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, and configure Prometheus monitoring and auto-scaling rules. The business value is to achieve real-time insights to drive automated responses, with typical scenarios such as fraud detection enhancing user security experience."
