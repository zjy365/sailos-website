  "content": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines infrastructure resources through code to enable automated configuration management. Its importance lies in improving efficiency, reducing human errors, and supporting hybrid cloud environments by integrating public and private clouds, applied in scenarios such as cloud migration, elastic scaling, and standardized operation and maintenance.\n\nThe core components of IaC include declarative configurations (e.g., Terraform templates), version control systems (e.g., Git), and automation tools. Features like consistency, repeatability, and auditability ensure unified management of hybrid cloud resources. In practical applications, it eliminates cross-platform differences, enabling rapid cross-cloud deployment, environment replication, and drift detection, thereby optimizing DevOps processes and enhancing system reliability.\n\nTo implement IaC for simplifying hybrid cloud configuration: first, write multi-cloud compatible code templates to define resources; second, integrate version control and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment; third, perform testing and validation. Typical scenarios include bulk cloud migration, with business values such as reducing operational costs, shortening time-to-market (from days to minutes), and ensuring compliance."
