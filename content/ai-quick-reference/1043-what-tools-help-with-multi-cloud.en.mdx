Cloud orchestration and management involves the process of automatically coordinating resource deployment, configuration, and maintenance in a multi-cloud environment. Its importance lies in enhancing operational agility, reducing costs, and ensuring high availability, applicable to scenarios such as hybrid cloud deployment and disaster recovery optimization.

The core components include cross-cloud automation engines (such as infrastructure-as-code tools), unified API interfaces, and monitoring systems, characterized by policy-driven orchestration, high scalability, and security compliance. In practical applications, it supports unified resource scheduling, application migration, and load balancing, significantly reducing complexity and driving the implementation of cloud-native strategies.

Tool applications achieve automated deployment and cross-cloud resource optimization through infrastructure-as-code platforms (such as Terraform) and Kubernetes orchestration systems (such as OpenShift). The value lies in improving resource utilization, reducing vendor lock-in risks, and accelerating business continuity.
