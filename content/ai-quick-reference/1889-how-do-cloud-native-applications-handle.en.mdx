Cloud-native applications typically adopt inter-service communication mechanisms to achieve decoupled, dynamic, and scalable microservice interactions. Its importance lies in supporting the resilience, observability, and independent deployment of distributed systems, serving as a core capability for building agile and scalable applications, widely used in complex business scenarios such as e-commerce and finance.

Core mechanisms include service discovery (e.g., Kubernetes Services), lightweight communication protocols (HTTP/REST, gRPC), and service meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd). Service meshes, through transparent injection of Sidecar proxies, manage traffic (load balancing, routing), enhance security (mTLS), improve resilience (circuit breaking, retries), and boost observability (monitoring, tracing), significantly simplifying communication complexity.

Practical operations include: 1. Service Discovery: Using Kubernetes DNS or registries (e.g., Consul) to locate service instances. 2. API Communication: Making calls through well-defined APIs (REST/gRPC). 3. Service Mesh Integration: Deploying mesh components and injecting proxies to automatically handle secure transmission of inter-service traffic, load balancing, and resilience policies (e.g., configuring timeouts and retries), enabling non-intrusive communication governance and improving overall reliability and operational efficiency.
