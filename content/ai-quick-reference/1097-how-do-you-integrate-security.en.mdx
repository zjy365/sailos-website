Hybrid cloud deployment integrates public and private cloud resources, while security policies refer to the rules and measures for protecting data and applications. Its importance lies in ensuring cross-environment consistency, data security, and compliance, and it is applied in enterprise IT, finance, and multi-cloud architectures.

The core components include unified identity access management, data encryption, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring. Features involve automated policy enforcement, zero-trust architecture, and the implementation of network policies or tool integration for cloud natives such as Kubernetes, which significantly enhance the overall security posture and reduce cross-cloud vulnerability risks.

Implementation steps: First, assess compliance requirements and define a policy framework; second, deploy centralized tools such as CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) for unified management; third, automate policy application to all cloud environments and conduct continuous auditing. Typical scenarios include DevOps pipeline deployment, and business value is reflected in reducing security risks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and operational resilience.
