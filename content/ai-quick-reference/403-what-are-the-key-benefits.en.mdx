Microservices is an architectural pattern that decomposes complex applications into small, independent service units, where each service performs specific functions and communicates via APIs. Its importance lies in enhancing development agility and system maintainability, making it particularly suitable for cloud computing environments such as containerization and Kubernetes management, supporting rapid iteration and the development of highly available internet applications.

Core characteristics include loose coupling, autonomy, and independent deployability; services can be built based on different technology stacks, promoting decentralized control. In practical applications, such as e-commerce platforms, multiple teams can develop and release services in parallel, reducing the impact of global failures, and driving DevOps practices and resource optimization.

Key benefits include accelerated release cycles through independent deployment, improved performance efficiency via elastic scaling, enhanced system fault tolerance through failure isolation, and enriched solutions enabled by technological diversity. This architecture delivers business value, including cost reduction, increased market responsiveness, and support for large-scale innovation.
