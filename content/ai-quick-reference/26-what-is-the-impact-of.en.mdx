Cloud-native development is a methodology for building and running applications based on cloud environments, emphasizing containerization, microservices, automation, and continuous delivery. By enhancing development agility and resource elasticity, it addresses the issues of difficult scaling and slow deployment of traditional monolithic applications, making it suitable for high-concurrency, rapidly iterative internet applications and enterprise digital transformation scenarios.

Core features include microservice architecture for decoupling code, containers (such as Docker) for encapsulating environmental dependencies, and Kubernetes for automated orchestration and operation. This model directly impacts the development cycle: automated CI/CD pipelines (such as Jenkins) shorten testing and deployment time, independent development of microservices reduces team collaboration bottlenecks, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) improves environmental consistency, thereby accelerating iteration and reducing release risks.

Cloud-native significantly shortens the development cycle, with value reflected in high-frequency releases (e.g., daily deployments), rapid fault recovery, and resource optimization. Through standardized toolchains and elastic scaling, teams can focus on business innovation, improve market response speed, and ultimately achieve a development efficiency increase of over 30% and enhanced business competitiveness.
