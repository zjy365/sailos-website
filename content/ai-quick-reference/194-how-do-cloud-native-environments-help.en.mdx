Cloud-native environments significantly simplify data processing workflows through microservices architecture, containerization, and dynamic orchestration technologies. Their core value lies in enhancing development agility, resource utilization, and system resilience, making them suitable for scenarios such as real-time stream processing, batch processing, and machine learning pipelines.

The core components include Kubernetes automated orchestration (enabling elastic scaling and fault self-healing of workflow components), service mesh (simplifying inter-service communication and monitoring), and Serverless frameworks (executing stateless tasks on demand). These features allow data processing pipelines to automatically adapt to load changes, achieve fine-grained resource allocation, and reduce operational complexity through declarative configuration.

Practical implementation requires: 1) Containerizing data processing steps into independent microservices; 2) Using Kubernetes Jobs/CronJobs or Argo Workflows to define task dependencies and scheduling strategies; 3) Integrating monitoring and logging tools (such as Prometheus/Grafana) to achieve full-link observability. This solution shortens the data processing cycle by over 50% while reducing infrastructure management costs.
