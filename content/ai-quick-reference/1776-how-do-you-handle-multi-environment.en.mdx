Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure definitions into manageable code, offering advantages of efficient and repeatable deployment in cloud-native and large-scale applications. Its importance lies in ensuring environmental consistency and reducing human errors; application scenarios include the management of development, testing, and production environments, supporting agile iteration and continuous delivery.

Core components include modular design (implemented through tools like Terraform), version control (such as Git), and environment-specific variables (parameterized configurations). In practical applications, differences are handled based on environment isolation and dynamic injection to improve scalability; impacts include accelerating resource orchestration, enhancing compliance, and reducing operational costs.

Processing methods: First, establish modular IaC templates; second, define variable files for each environment (e.g., for dev/prod); third, integrate CI/CD pipelines (such as Jenkins or Argo CD) to automate testing and deployment. Typical scenarios involve microservice deployment, with business values including increasing release speed, ensuring environmental consistency, and optimizing resource utilization.
