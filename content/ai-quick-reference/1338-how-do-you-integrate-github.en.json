  "content": "GitHub Actions is a built-in CI/CD tool of GitHub, used to automate software building, testing, and deployment processes. Its importance lies in simplifying the development cycle, reducing manual operations, and improving efficiency. Application scenarios include open-source projects and enterprise-level applications, supporting continuous code integration and delivery to ensure rapid feedback and release.\n\nCore components include workflow files (in YAML format), jobs (defining task units), and steps (executing specific commands). Triggers such as code push or pull request automatically start the process. In practical applications, it can integrate automated testing, container image building, and deploy to Kubernetes or cloud platforms, directly contributing to improved code quality and faster deployment.\n\nImplementation steps: Create a `.github/workflows` directory in the GitHub repository and add a workflow YAML file; define trigger events (such as on: push), configure jobs (such as jobs: build) containing steps (such as actions/checkout to check out code, run test commands); the pipeline is automatically executed after committing the file. Business values include accelerating the iteration cycle, reducing the cost of human errors, and typical scenarios achieving multiple deployments per day."
