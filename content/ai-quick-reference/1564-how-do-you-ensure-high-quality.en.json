  "content": "High observability refers to the ability to monitor system behavior in real-time through logs, metrics, and traces. In a multi-cloud environment, this capability is crucial for ensuring system reliability, quickly diagnosing faults, and optimizing performance, with application scenarios including microservice architectures deployed across multiple clouds or disaster recovery strategies.\n\nThe core components include unified log management (such as the ELK Stack), performance metrics collection (such as Prometheus), and distributed tracing (such as Jaeger). Data aggregation using standardized protocols like OpenTelemetry ensures consistent monitoring across platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, improving operational efficiency and reducing downtime caused by cross-cloud differences.\n\nImplementation steps: First, deploy a cross-cloud observability framework such as OpenTelemetry to collect data; second, integrate tools like Datadog or Grafana for real-time analysis; finally, establish alert mechanisms and consistency checks. Typical scenarios involve monitoring application performance, with business values including ensuring high availability, optimizing costs, and enhancing user experience."
