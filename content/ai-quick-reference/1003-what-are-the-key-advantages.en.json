  "content": "Hybrid cloud architecture combines public and private cloud environments to form a unified IT infrastructure. Its importance lies in providing flexibility, compliance, and cost optimization, suitable for enterprise scenarios requiring elastic scaling, sensitive data processing, or global business operations, such as the finance, healthcare, and e-commerce industries.\n\nCore components include public cloud services, private data centers, secure connections (e.g., VPN or API gateways), and unified management tools. Features involve dynamic resource allocation, load balancing, and data sovereignty. In practical applications, it improves operational efficiency, accelerates cloud-native migration, enhances disaster recovery capabilities, and drives enterprise digital transformation and risk control.\n\nKey advantages encompass flexible resource scaling, cost savings, enhanced security, and high availability. Application value is reflected in optimizing operational expenditures, improving business continuity, supporting innovative experiments, directly enhancing enterprise competitiveness, and enabling agile response to market changes."
