In cloud-native environments, data high availability refers to ensuring continuous data accessibility and preventing service interruptions through redundancy and automation mechanisms in distributed systems. It is crucial in critical applications such as online finance or e-commerce, as it enhances business continuity, user satisfaction, and reduces potential losses.

The core components include data replication, persistent storage, and failover mechanisms. Kubernetes' StatefulSets are used to manage stateful services, while Persistent Volumes (PV) and Volume Claims (PVC) provide storage abstraction. In practice, cross-cloud redundancy is achieved through distributed databases or multi-region deployments, supporting automatic recovery and load balancing, which significantly enhances system resilience and reliability.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy StatefulSets in Kubernetes to define multi-replica services; 2. Configure persistent volumes bound to reliable backends such as cloud storage (e.g., AWS EBS); 3. Enable automatic backup policies; 4. Integrate multi-region architecture for geographical redundancy. A typical scenario is e-commerce systems using highly available data to reduce downtime, thereby increasing business revenue and customer trust.
