  "content": "The continuous availability of cloud-native applications refers to the seamless operation of applications in cloud environments, avoiding downtime. Its importance lies in ensuring business continuity, coping with load peaks or failures, and is applicable to real-time service scenarios such as e-commerce and finance.\n\nCore components include multi-replica deployment to enhance redundancy, load balancing to distribute traffic, and automatic failover mechanisms such as Kubernetes' self-healing function. These features improve system resilience, reduce the risk of interruptions, and affect the reliability and large-scale application of cloud-native architectures.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy multi-instance Pods using Kubernetes and configure replica sets. 2. Integrate service meshes or load balancers to manage traffic. 3. Set up health probes to trigger automatic recovery. 4. Monitor metrics such as Prometheus alerts. The business value is to maximize uptime, reduce revenue loss, and enhance user experience and brand trust."
