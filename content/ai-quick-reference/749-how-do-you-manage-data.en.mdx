In cloud-native environments, data retention policies define data storage durations and deletion rules to ensure compliance and cost optimization. Their importance lies in meeting regulations (such as GDPR) and supporting resource efficiency; application scenarios include log file processing, database backups, and container persistent volume management.

Core components include time-based or event-based policies (e.g., retention days, snapshot cycles), integrated with cloud-native tools like Velero (for backups) or external storage plugins (object storage lifecycle policies). Features include automation and high scalability; in practical applications, policies reduce manual cleanup burdens, enhance data auditability, and adapt to dynamic microservice deployments.

Management steps: first, assess compliance requirements and define policies; second, select tools such as Kubernetes Operators (Velero) or cloud services (AWS S3 rules); third, implement automation through CI/CD processes or API scripts; finally, test and monitor policy execution. Typical scenarios are log rotation or snapshot archiving; business values include reducing storage costs, enhancing regulatory compliance, and supporting resilient business continuity.
