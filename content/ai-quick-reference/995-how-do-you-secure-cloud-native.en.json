  "content": "Cloud-native applications are modern applications that run in cloud environments based on containerization and microservices architecture. Protecting them from unauthorized access is crucial to prevent data breaches, service disruptions, and support highly compliant scenarios such as finance or healthcare.\n\nCore components include identity authentication (e.g., OAuth/JWT), role-based access control (RBAC), and service meshes (e.g., Istio) to implement authorization policies, along with network policies to isolate service communications. These mechanisms are practically applied through a zero-trust security model, reducing the impact of internal and external threats and enhancing the overall defense capabilities of distributed environments.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy strong identity authentication mechanisms to manage user access. 2. Configure Kubernetes RBAC and network policies to restrict inter-service interactions. 3. Use API gateways and service meshes to encrypt traffic. Typical scenarios include microservice deployments, with business values including enhanced compliance, reduced security risks, and efficient operations."
