Integrating container orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes) with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (such as Terraform) aims to automate the unified management of infrastructure and application deployment, enhancing consistency, reliability, and efficiency. This is crucial in cloud-native environments, promoting DevOps practices, and is applied in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and multi-cloud strategies.

Core components include IaC defining basic resources (such as networks, virtual machines), and orchestration platforms managing container lifecycles; features involve API calls, state synchronization, and tool plugins (such as Terraform's Kubernetes provider). In principle, after IaC deploys the cluster, it triggers orchestration configurations (such as Helm charts) to achieve end-to-end automation. The practical impact is reducing errors, accelerating deployment, and supporting highly available applications.

Implementation steps: 1. IaC defines platform infrastructure (such as creating an EKS cluster); 2. Orchestration resource configuration (such as Kubernetes manifests); 3. Automated execution (such as CI/CD scripts). A typical scenario is an application deployment pipeline; business values include standardized processes, cost reduction and efficiency improvement, and enhanced scalability.
