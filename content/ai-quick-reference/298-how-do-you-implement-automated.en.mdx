Automated deployment refers to using tools to automatically execute the software release process. It is crucial for legacy applications as it can significantly reduce manual deployment errors, increase release frequency, and accelerate issue resolution, especially suitable for maintaining critical but architecturally outdated business systems.

The core implementation includes the following steps:

1. Containerization/Packaging: Use Docker to encapsulate the application and its dependencies into images to ensure environment consistency.

2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Establish an automated pipeline (such as Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automatically trigger image building, unit and integration testing.

3. Deployment Strategy: Define declarative deployment manifests (such as Deployment or Playbook) through Kubernetes or traditional configuration management tools (such as Ansible), supporting rolling updates and blue-green deployment to reduce risks.

4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use tools like Terraform to automatically manage the infrastructure required for deployment (such as servers, networks).

This solution can greatly improve deployment efficiency, reduce human errors, and enhance predictability. Typical steps: first encapsulate the application into a container image; configure the CI/CD pipeline to handle building and testing; use IaC to configure the environment; finally realize automated deployment and verification through orchestration tools. This injects agility into legacy systems and provides reliable business value.
