Cloud-native data management leverages containerization technology and Kubernetes to orchestrate data workflows, enabling scalability and elasticity. Continuous data integration emphasizes real-time consolidation of multiple data sources to support agile development. In microservices architecture and big data analytics scenarios, its importance lies in reducing data latency, improving processing speed, and accelerating decision-making processes.

The core of this concept is deploying data pipelines as microservices and automating the lifecycle management of data tasks through Kubernetes Operators. Features include declarative configuration and dynamic resource scheduling, supporting data source isolation and ensuring high availability. In practical applications, this enables event-driven data flows, such as optimizing end-to-end integration in real-time analytics or cross-service data synchronization scenarios, enhancing reliability and efficiency.

Implementation steps: First, containerize data storage and sources; then deploy tools like Debezium or Argo Workflows for change capture; finally, integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and release. Typical scenarios include real-time data warehouse updates and message queue integration. Business value includes reducing operational costs, improving data freshness, and accelerating innovation cycles.
