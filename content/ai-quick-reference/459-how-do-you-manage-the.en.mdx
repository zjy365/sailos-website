Microservice lifecycle management refers to the systematic governance of the entire process of service building, version control, deployment, monitoring, scaling, and decommissioning. It is crucial because the microservice architecture is highly decoupled, requiring thousands of independent services to collaborate efficiently and reliably in a distributed environment to achieve continuous delivery and rapid iteration.

The core processes include: 1) Building and testing: Implementing automated compilation, unit/integration testing through CI/CD; 2) Deployment and release: Leveraging orchestration tools such as Kubernetes for rolling updates, blue-green deployments, or canary releases; 3) Runtime operations and maintenance: Integrating monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), logging (e.g., ELK), and tracing (e.g., Jaeger) to achieve real-time observability; 4) Scaling and self-healing: HPA automatic scaling based on traffic metrics, combined with health checks to automatically restart abnormal instances; 5) Version iteration and decommissioning: Standardizing API version compatibility and cleaning up idle services.

Implementation steps: 1) Integrating version control with CI pipelines; 2) Containerizing services and defining Helm/Kustomize deployment templates; 3) Configuring service meshes (Istio/Linkerd) to govern traffic; 4) Setting metric alarm thresholds and automated scaling policies; 5) Performing full release after gray-scale verification; 6) Regularly auditing service status and archiving old versions. This management approach significantly improves release frequency, system resilience, and resource utilization.
