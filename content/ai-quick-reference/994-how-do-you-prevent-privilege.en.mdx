Privilege escalation is a security threat where attackers escalate from lower privileges to higher ones, which is particularly dangerous in cloud-native applications as their containerized environments can amplify vulnerabilities. Preventing this issue is crucial to ensure data integrity and security compliance of cloud-native systems such as Kubernetes clusters, with application scenarios including microservice deployment and CI/CD processes.

Core strategies include the principle of least privilege, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Pod Security Policies, and namespace isolation. RBAC restricts resource access, Pod Security Policies harden the container runtime environment, and network policies control inter-service communication. Practical implementation is achieved through Kubernetes role bindings and service account configurations, significantly reducing the attack surface and enhancing the security resilience of the cloud-native ecosystem.

Implementation steps: Define least privilege roles and assign only necessary permissions; configure RBAC rules to restrict Pod and API access; apply PodSecurityPolicy or update standard constraints for privileges. A typical scenario is a multi-tenant Kubernetes environment. Business values include reducing intrusion risks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and improving system reliability.
