  "content": "Cloud-native applications run in containerized environments, and real-time monitoring of user activities can promptly identify performance bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors, thereby enhancing application reliability. Application scenarios include user interaction tracking in e-commerce or financial services.\n\nCore components include log aggregation (such as log collection by Fluentd), metric collection (such as real-time metrics like HTTP requests extracted by Prometheus), and visualization tools (such as Grafana). Based on an event-driven architecture, the monitoring process is automated through Kubernetes Operator to reduce latency, support fault diagnosis, and optimize user experience.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana and configure custom metrics. 2. Integrate application logs to identify user behaviors. 3. Set up real-time alerts (such as Slack notifications). Typical scenarios include shopping cart activity tracking; business value is reflected in improving conversion rates and reducing downtime losses."
