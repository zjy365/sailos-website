Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure configuration by defining setups in code files, instead of manual processes. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control, vital for cloud deployments, DevOps workflows, and scalable environments like Kubernetes, reducing human error and enabling agile development.

IaC relies on declarative config languages such as Terraform's HCL or AWS CloudFormation, along with tools like Ansible for provisioning. Key features include reusability and testability, allowing automation of servers, networks, and storage. This streamlines deployments in cloud-native applications, boosting operational efficiency and minimizing downtime.

Implement by drafting IaC files specifying resources, applying with tools like terraform apply, and integrating into CI/CD pipelines for automated validation. Typical scenarios include orchestrated updates across environments, yielding faster deployments, lower costs, and enhanced reliability in production systems.
