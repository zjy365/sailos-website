High availability ensures that microservices remain available in the event of hardware or software failures, which is crucial for business continuity and user experience. It is applicable to scenarios requiring zero downtime, such as online transactions and real-time services.

Core components include service redundancy (e.g., multiple replica instances), load balancing, automatic failover, and health checks. The principle is based on distributed design, such as Kubernetes Deployment configuring replicas and rolling updates, combined with service discovery to achieve self-healing. This enhances system resilience and elasticity, reducing the risk of single points of failure.

Implementation steps: Deploy multiple service replicas; configure load balancers (such as Ingress or service mesh); set up health probes to monitor status; enable automatic scaling (HPA) and failure recovery; perform database redundant backups. Typical cloud environment applications support 99.99% availability, reducing downtime losses and operational costs.
