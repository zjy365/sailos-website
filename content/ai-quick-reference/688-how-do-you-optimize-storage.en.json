  "content": "Cloud-native data management handles the data lifecycle in containerized and Kubernetes environments, and optimizing its storage costs is crucial, which can reduce cloud service expenses and improve resource efficiency. It is applied in high-throughput scenarios such as real-time analysis and machine learning workflows.\n\nThe core includes Kubernetes Storage Classes for configuring storage tiers, dynamic binding of Persistent Volumes (PV), data compression and deduplication, and lifecycle automation. Through hot/cold data tiering (e.g., SSD to archive S3), redundant storage is reduced and elastic scaling is achieved, thereby significantly lowering storage costs by 30-50% and improving enterprise total cost of ownership efficiency.\n\nOptimization implementation steps: 1. Adopt a tiered storage architecture (e.g., AWS Intelligent Tiering); 2. Integrate compression and deduplication tools (e.g., gzip); 3. Set up automatic lifecycle policies to migrate inactive data to low-cost storage; 4. Regular snapshots and cleanup of old backups. A typical scenario is that Kubernetes clusters use CSI drivers to deploy storage strategies, enabling on-demand configuration and cost savings."
