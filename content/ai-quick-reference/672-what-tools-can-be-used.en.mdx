In cloud-native environments, real-time data processing is crucial for instant decision-making, user experience, and operational monitoring. It requires rapid ingestion, processing of massive streaming data, and output of low-latency insights under containerized, microservices architectures. Typical scenarios include real-time monitoring, fraud detection, personalized recommendations, and IoT data processing.

Core tools consist of three categories: stream processing engines (such as Apache Flink and Spark Streaming for processing streaming data), messaging/streaming platforms (such as Apache Kafka and Pulsar providing high-throughput data pipelines), and real-time databases (such as TimeScaleDB and Apache Druid supporting fast queries). These tools are designed to be cloud-native: supporting containerized deployment (Kubernetes Operator), elastic scaling, high availability, and service discovery (integrated with Service Mesh). Platforms like KSQL and Flink SQL provide SQL interfaces to simplify development.

Its implementation value lies in instantly mining business value from streaming data. Typical steps: 1) Ingest data streams from source systems via Kafka/Pulsar; 2) Define stream processing logic (filtering, aggregation, joining) using Flink/Spark Streaming; 3) Write results to real-time databases or downstream services; 4) Use Grafana/Prometheus for visual monitoring. This enables second-level decision loops, dynamic user experience optimization, and real-time anomaly detection.
