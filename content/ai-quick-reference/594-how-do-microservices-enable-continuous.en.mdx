Microservices are the division of applications into independent, small, and independently deployable service components. Continuous Deployment and Delivery (CD) are crucial here, enabling agile updates, risk reduction, and supporting high-frequency iterations in cloud-native environments such as e-commerce platforms through automation.

The core involves automated CI/CD pipelines, containerization (e.g., encapsulating services with Docker), service registration, and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes). Features include independent deployment capabilities and loosely coupled design; the principle is based on a rapid build-test-deploy cycle, supporting blue-green or canary release strategies, which significantly enhance system resilience and reduce deployment failures.

Implementation steps include: establishing automated build and testing processes; containerizing and orchestrating microservices; integrating deployment tools (such as ArgoCD); and gradually rolling out and monitoring the effects of changes. A typical scenario is cloud service updates, with business values being accelerated market responsiveness (release cycles from months to hours), enhanced reliability, and optimized costs.
