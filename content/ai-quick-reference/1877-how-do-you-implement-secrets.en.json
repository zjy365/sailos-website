  "content": "Key management refers to the process of securely storing and accessing sensitive data such as passwords and API keys, which is crucial in cloud-native applications to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of microservices and containerized environments. Its importance lies in preventing data breaches and unauthorized access, with application scenarios including configuration encryption in Kubernetes deployments and DevOps pipelines.\n\nThe core components include centralized repositories (such as Vault or Kubernetes Secrets), encryption technologies (end-to-end protection), fine-grained access control (RBAC policies), and key rotation mechanisms. These features ensure dynamic secure access during runtime and reduce exposure risks. In practical applications, the impacts include enhancing microservice security and supporting zero-trust architecture, for example, protecting database credentials through API integration.\n\nThe implementation steps are: 1) Select tools (such as Vault or AWS Secrets Manager); 2) Configure secure storage and encryption; 3) Define access policies and rotation plans; 4) Integrate into applications through environment variables or APIs; 5) Continuously monitor and audit. Typical scenarios include simplifying compliance (such as GDPR), and the business value is reducing breach risks and optimizing operational efficiency."
