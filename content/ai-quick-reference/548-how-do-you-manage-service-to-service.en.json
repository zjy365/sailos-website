  "content": "Inter-service communication is the process by which microservices exchange data over a network. Ensuring secure communication is crucial to prevent data breaches and attacks, and to enhance system reliability. In cloud-native applications such as Kubernetes clusters, this management is used in service invocation and container orchestration scenarios.\n\nThe core includes mTLS (mutual Transport Layer Security) to provide end-to-end encryption, service meshes like Istio to implement automatic TLS, and authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only legitimate services interact. Based on the zero-trust principle, it isolates access control, reduces network risks, and strengthens security boundaries in distributed environments.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy service mesh tools; 2. Configure mTLS to encrypt all communications; 3. Define network policies to restrict traffic. A typical scenario is inter-service access within Kubernetes, bringing business values such as enhanced data privacy, reduced probability of security incidents, and meeting compliance audit requirements."
