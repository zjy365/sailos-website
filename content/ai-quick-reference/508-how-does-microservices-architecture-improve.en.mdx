Microservices architecture decomposes an application into small, independent services, each managed by a dedicated team. Its importance lies in promoting team autonomy and reducing conflicts, commonly seen in large agile development project scenarios. The core characteristics are loose coupling and service independence, allowing teams to focus on a single service and interact using well-defined APIs. This enhances collaboration, such as reducing dependency conflicts, accelerating parallel development, and localizing problem troubleshooting. It is implemented by decomposing business capabilities, empowering team autonomy, and defining API contracts. Typical scenarios include continuous deployment environments, bringing business values such as rapid product iteration, reduced risk, and improved system scalability.
