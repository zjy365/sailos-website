Multi-cloud deployment optimizes resource allocation by combining multiple cloud services, and its optimization is crucial for business resilience and cost control. While ensuring high application availability, it is necessary to avoid vendor lock-in and match business peak demand. Typical scenarios include global application distribution, disaster recovery backup, and utilization of differentiated services from different cloud providers.

The core of optimization covers three aspects: architectural design using CDN and intelligent DNS to improve access performance; automation tools such as Kubernetes to achieve cross-cloud container orchestration; and cost monitoring using CloudHealth or CAST AI for real-time expenditure analysis. Key principles include scheduling computationally intensive workloads to high-performance clouds, storing cold data in low-cost object storage, and reducing costs through mixed procurement of reserved instances and spot instances.

Implementation steps are divided into three phases: 1. Workload analysis - using tools to evaluate resource consumption patterns of each application; 2. Policy automation - deploying infrastructure as code through Terraform and configuring cross-cloud elastic scaling rules; 3. Continuous optimization - establishing a metrics dashboard, reviewing monthly, and migrating non-critical tasks to more cost-effective platforms. Typical benefits include a 15%-40% reduction in latency and 20%-35% annual cloud expenditure savings.
