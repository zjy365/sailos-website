  "content": "In a microservices environment, service versioning refers to the process of managing different iterative versions of services to ensure compatibility and system evolution. It is crucial for maintaining the stability of distributed systems and avoiding disruptions, especially applicable to rapidly iterative cloud-native scenarios such as rolling deployments.\n\nIts core features include semantic versioning mechanisms, API versioning (via URI paths or header fields), and deployment strategies like blue-green deployment or canary deployment. These components facilitate independent service releases and backward compatibility, which in practical applications improve the efficiency of DevOps processes and reduce integration risks.\n\nProcessing steps: Define a clear versioning strategy and use Kubernetes labels to isolate Pods of different versions; route requests through an API gateway during deployment. A typical scenario is zero-downtime updates, and the business value lies in enhancing system resilience and business continuity."
