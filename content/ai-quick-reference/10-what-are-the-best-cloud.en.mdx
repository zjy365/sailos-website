Cloud-native development environments are based on containerization and Kubernetes technologies, enabling agile development, continuous deployment, and microservices architecture on cloud platforms. The importance of such environments lies in improving development efficiency, supporting elastic resource management and DevOps practices, and they are applied in modern software development, innovative projects, and high-availability system deployments. The best cloud platforms offer managed services to simplify the setup process.

Core components include managed Kubernetes services (such as EKS, AKS, GKE), CI/CD toolchains, container registries, and service meshes. In practical applications, the platform automatically handles cluster configuration, monitoring, and scaling, enhancing scalability and security. This drives the development of the cloud-native ecosystem, leading to shorter development cycles, reduced operational costs, and improved business agility.

Recommended platforms include AWS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), Azure (Azure Kubernetes Service), and GCP (Google Kubernetes Engine). Their value lies in mature ecosystems, integrated development tools, global availability zones, and cost optimization, making them suitable for enterprise cloud migration, multi-cloud deployments, and rapid prototyping.
