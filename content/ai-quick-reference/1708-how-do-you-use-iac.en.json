  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) uses code to automate the management of infrastructure configurations. Configuration drift detection is used to monitor deviations between the actual state and the code-defined state, ensuring consistency, security, and compliance. It is crucial in cloud computing and DevOps environments, applied to reduce manual errors and improve the efficiency of automated operations and maintenance.\n\nThe core components include the declarative configuration model of IaC tools (such as Terraform) and scanning mechanisms that regularly compare infrastructure states. It features automated difference reporting and alert systems. The principle relies on code defining the desired state, and in practical applications, it is integrated into CI/CD pipelines to detect configuration deviations in Kubernetes clusters, enhancing reliability and security compliance control.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define infrastructure state code (e.g., Terraform files). 2. Select a drift detection tool (e.g., Driftctl or Terraform's built-in features). 3. Automate regular scans (e.g., via Cron jobs). 4. Set up alerts and remediate (e.g., automatically apply code or manually adjust). A typical scenario is reducing downtime in cloud-native deployments, with business values including reduced risk, optimized costs, and improved operational resilience."
