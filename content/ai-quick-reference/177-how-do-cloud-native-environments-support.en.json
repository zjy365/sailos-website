  "content": "Cloud-native environments support the multi-tenancy requirements of large organizations through container orchestration, microservices architecture, and declarative APIs. The core value lies in ensuring resource isolation, security compliance, and self-service capabilities among tenants (such as departments and customer groups) while sharing infrastructure, making it suitable for scenarios like SaaS platforms and enterprise internal platformization.\n\nKey technologies include: 1) Kubernetes Namespaces for logical resource partitioning and quota limitations; 2) Network policies (e.g., NetworkPolicy) to control inter-tenant communication; 3) Fine-grained permission management based on RBAC; 4) Multi-tenant CI/CD pipelines. These capabilities ensure isolation of tenants' computing, storage, network, and configurations, while implementing fine-grained traffic governance through service meshes (e.g., Istio). Operators automate tenant lifecycle management and improve operational efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps typically involve: 1) Defining a tenant model (e.g., independent Namespace per tenant); 2) Configuring resource quotas (ResourceQuota) and limit ranges (LimitRange); 3) Deploying network isolation policies; 4) Providing self-service tenant resource provisioning through cluster APIs or platform portals; 5) Integrating monitoring and billing systems. The ultimate goals are optimized resource utilization, independent operation and maintenance domain management, and rapid tenant business delivery."
