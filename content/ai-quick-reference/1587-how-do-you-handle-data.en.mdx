Cloud-native application metrics refer to performance data generated by applications in containerized environments (such as CPU usage, request latency). Data visualization converts this into charts or dashboards, with importance lying in enhancing monitoring transparency and enabling rapid anomaly detection. Application scenarios include real-time operation and maintenance monitoring, ensuring microservice reliability, and SLA compliance.

Core components include metric collection tools (e.g., Prometheus), data processing layers (e.g., InfluxDB or TimescaleDB), and visualization engines (e.g., Grafana). Features involve low-latency queries, multi-dimensional filtering, and scalability; the principle is based on continuous scraping and aggregation of metrics. In practical applications, integrating the Prometheus Operator with Kubernetes to extract metrics and creating interactive dashboards with Grafana effectively support DevOps teams in analyzing error rates and resource bottlenecks.

Implementation steps: First, deploy an agent (e.g., Node Exporter) to collect data; second, configure data sources (e.g., Prometheus scrape); finally, design visualization dashboards (Grafana templates). Typical scenarios include monitoring cluster health or API latency. Business value includes reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR), optimizing costs, and improving user satisfaction.
