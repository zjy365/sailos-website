In cloud-native applications, data deduplication refers to the process of eliminating duplicate data copies to improve storage efficiency, reduce network transmission load, and lower costs. It is crucial for optimizing stateful application performance, saving object storage (e.g., S3) expenses, and accelerating data transmission between distributed services, commonly used in scenarios such as log aggregation, event stream processing (Kafka), and big data analytics.

Core implementation methods include content-based hashing (e.g., SHA-256) for exact deduplication: generating unique fingerprints for data and storing them in key-value databases (Redis); near-real-time deduplication in stream processing relying on proxy layers (e.g., Nginx or Envoy) to intercept duplicate requests through in-memory caching; message queues (Kafka or Pulsar) can integrate deduplication logic on the producer side or implement it at the storage layer (e.g., Cassandra Bloom filters). Key features are algorithm efficiency, distributed state management, and eventual consistency guarantees.

Practical steps:

1. Identify sources: Analyze high-incidence points of duplicates in data pipelines (logs, object uploads, event sources).

2. Select solutions: Use in-memory caching (Redis) for high-frequency small data; use content hashing + metadata databases for large file storage; integrate proxies or SDKs in stream processing.

3. Tool integration: Deploy Redis clusters as fingerprint libraries; configure Envoy filters to implement request deduplication; or choose storage services with built-in deduplication (e.g., S3 Intelligent-Tiering).

4. Monitor and optimize: Track changes in deduplication rate, latency, and storage costs, dynamically adjust hash granularity or caching strategies. Ultimately reduce storage costs by 30%-70% and improve data processing throughput.
