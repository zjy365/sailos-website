  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) automates the management of infrastructure resources through code, while API lifecycle management covers stages such as API design, deployment, monitoring, and retirement. Its importance lies in enhancing the repeatability and consistency of APIs, reducing human errors, and it is widely used in cloud-native microservice architectures, such as automatically deploying API gateway configurations to improve operational efficiency.\n\nCore components include IaC tools (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation) for declaratively defining API resources (e.g., routes, policies, and authentication); features involve version control, automated testing, and environment drift detection. The principle is to store API configurations as code, combined with API management platforms (e.g., Kong or Apigee), supporting elastic scaling and version iteration of infrastructure. In practical applications, it simplifies DevOps processes, enhances resource tracking and compliance auditing.\n\nImplementation steps: Define IaC scripts to describe API resources; integrate CI/CD pipelines to achieve automatic deployment; add monitoring and alerting mechanisms. Business values include accelerating API release (shortening the time from development to production), reducing operational risks, ensuring environmental consistency, and ultimately improving agility and cost-effectiveness."
