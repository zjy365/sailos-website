Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and manages infrastructure deployment through code, used for third-party service integration to achieve consistency and automation. Its importance includes reducing manual errors and improving efficiency. It is applied in cloud-native systems and microservice architectures to ensure reliable access and repeatable configuration of external services (such as databases or API providers).

Core IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation use declarative code to define components, featuring version control and automation. For third-party services, tools call APIs through provider plugins to manage configurations and lifecycles, enabling flexible integration. Practical applications include resource management in hybrid cloud environments, enhancing system scalability and resilience.

Implementation steps: Select an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform); write code to define third-party service interfaces (e.g., configure database credentials using plugins); automate deployment and testing. A typical scenario is in CI/CD pipelines, with business values including reducing operational risks, accelerating iteration cycles, and optimizing cost efficiency.
