  "content": "Multicloud refers to a strategy where enterprises use multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). It reduces vendor lock-in risk—the difficulty and high cost of migration caused by over-reliance on a single provider. Its importance lies in enhancing business continuity and flexibility of choice, applicable to digital transformation and global operation scenarios.\n\nIts core components include cross-provider workload distribution, the use of abstraction layers (such as Kubernetes for management and orchestration), and service interoperability. Its characteristics are achieving deployment elasticity and avoiding deep technical binding. In practical applications, it enhances resilience (such as disaster recovery), optimizes costs (through competitive bargaining), and drives cloud-native innovation.\n\nImplementing multicloud to reduce lock-in involves standardized steps: selecting compatible open-source tools (such as Terraform), avoiding proprietary APIs, and adopting a hybrid cloud architecture. Business values include reducing migration risks, enhancing bargaining power, and supporting long-term scalability, with typical scenarios such as data backup and elastic scaling."
