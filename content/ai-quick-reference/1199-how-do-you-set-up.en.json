  "content": "High-performance computing (HPC) involves using centralized computing resources to process intensive tasks, while hybrid cloud combines the security of private cloud with the scalability of public cloud. Its importance lies in providing elastic resources and reducing costs, with application scenarios including scientific simulation, AI model training, and engineering analysis.\n\nThe core components include local HPC clusters, public cloud instances (such as AWS Batch), and connection tools (such as dedicated networks or VPN). Features include on-demand scalability and data security; the principle is to process core tasks locally while using public cloud to support peak demand. In practical applications, it achieves resource optimization, with impacts including accelerated innovation and reduced infrastructure overhead.\n\nImplementation steps: Evaluate computing needs and workloads; design the architecture, integrating private facilities and cloud services (such as Azure HPC); deploy tools like job schedulers (Slurm) and network configurations; test performance and monitor. A typical scenario is for sudden computing peaks, and the business values are flexible scalability, improved economy, and reduced deployment risks."
