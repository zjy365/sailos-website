  "content": "Service orchestration in microservices architecture refers to the management of the execution order of multiple services by a coordinator to achieve automated coordination of business processes. It is crucial for ensuring service dependencies and transaction consistency, avoiding chaos in distributed systems; application scenarios include e-commerce order processing, involving the collaboration of payment, inventory, and logistics services.\n\nThe core components include workflow engines, API gateways, and message queues, characterized by centrally controlled sequential execution, error recovery, and state tracking. Its principle is based on defining business logic flows, handling dependencies through event-driven or step-by-step invocations; in practical applications, tools such as Camunda or AWS Step Functions implement complex process automation, with impacts including improved observability and simplified maintenance, though potential delays may be introduced.\n\nHandling service orchestration requires selecting orchestration tools such as Kubernetes Operators, designing workflow models to define service sequences, and implementing retry and compensation mechanisms. Typical scenarios involve executing cross-service transactions such as financial transactions, with business values including improved system resilience, reduced coupling, and accelerated business iteration."
