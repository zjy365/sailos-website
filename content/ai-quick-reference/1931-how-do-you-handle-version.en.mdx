Version control for cloud-native application components refers to managing the change history of containers, microservices, and configurations to ensure deployment consistency and traceability. Its importance lies in supporting rollbacks, avoiding conflicts, and facilitating team collaboration. Application scenarios include CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices in Kubernetes environments.

Core components include Git repositories for managing code changes, container image tags (such as semantic versions), and Helm charts for handling configurations. Features like immutability and automated releases are practically applied in CI/CD pipelines to achieve automatic version tracking, enhancing system reliability and maintainability while significantly reducing production environment errors.

Processing steps: Implement semantic versioning (e.g., major.minor.patch), bind versions to container images and Helm releases; integrate GitOps tools like ArgoCD to automate deployment processes. A typical scenario is zero-downtime updates; business values include accelerating iteration speed, reducing risks, and improving resource utilization.
