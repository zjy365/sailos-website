  "content": "Observability systems, which include logging, metrics, and tracing capabilities, are crucial in large-scale cloud-native applications. They support real-time monitoring and rapid troubleshooting, ensuring high availability and resilience, suitable for high-load scenarios such as e-commerce or financial services.\n\nCore components include distributed logging, performance metrics collection, and end-to-end request tracing. Features involve scalable architecture, efficient sampling, and context propagation. In practical applications, integrating tools like Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana can improve operational efficiency, reduce mean time to repair, and optimize resource utilization.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Adopt unified standards such as OpenTelemetry for integration tracing; 2. Optimize data storage and collection frequency; 3. Deploy intelligent sampling mechanisms; 4. Automate alert and dashboard configurations. Typical business values are enhancing system stability, reducing downtime, and supporting business expansion with lower costs."
