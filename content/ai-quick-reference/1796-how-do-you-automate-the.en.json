  "content": "IaC (Infrastructure as Code) defines and manages infrastructure resources through code. Its importance lies in automating operations and maintenance, reducing human errors, and improving efficiency. It is applied in managing the resource lifecycle and decommissioning scenarios in cloud environments.\n\nIts core includes code definition (such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation), version control, and CI/CD pipelines. The principle is to update resource status based on declarative configurations. When resource code is removed, CI/CD tools automatically trigger deletion operations, enabling automated resource decommissioning. This not only saves costs and avoids ghost resources but also enhances security compliance, and is widely used especially in virtual machine or storage cleanup.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) Describe the resource status in IaC; 2) Remove the code definition of the resource to be decommissioned; 3) Submit the change to trigger the CI/CD pipeline; 4) Execute the automation script to delete the resource; 5) Verify the result. Typical scenarios include regular cleanup of cloud VMs, bringing business values such as cost savings and policy compliance."
