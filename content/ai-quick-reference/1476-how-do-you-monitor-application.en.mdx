Monitoring microservice dependencies and communications involves tracking inter-service calls and communication status to ensure system reliability and performance. In distributed architectures, such monitoring is crucial as it prevents cascading failures, accelerates fault isolation, and is applied in cloud-native environments to support high availability and debugging scenarios.

Core components include service dependency graph visualization for interaction paths, communication metrics (such as latency, error rates, and throughput), and distributed tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger or OpenTelemetry). In practical applications, integrating log collectors and metric monitors (such as Prometheus) provides end-to-end visibility, significantly reducing diagnosis time and improving system observability and stability.

Implementation steps: 1. Define monitoring strategies and identify key dependencies; 2. Deploy tools like service meshes (e.g., Istio) for automated data collection; 3. Integrate logging and tracing systems; 4. Configure dashboards and alerts. Business values include improved application availability, reduced MTTR, optimized resource utilization efficiency, thereby ensuring business continuity and user experience.
