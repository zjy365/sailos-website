  "content": "A multi-cloud environment involves the use of multiple cloud service providers, aiming to optimize costs, enhance redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in. Workload distribution refers to the dynamic deployment of computing tasks across different cloud platforms to match requirements. Its importance lies in enhancing business resilience, optimizing geographical coverage, and achieving cost savings. Typical application scenarios include global load balancing, disaster recovery, and hybrid cloud deployment.\n\nCore components include container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes and its multi-cluster management, policy engines that define rules, and unified API gateways. Features involve policy-driven decisions (e.g., allocation based on cost or performance), auto-scaling, and consistent cross-cloud monitoring. In practical applications, it supports multi-cluster deployment, enhances fault tolerance, significantly reduces maintenance overhead, and promotes efficient resource utilization.\n\nImplementation steps: First, configure a unified Kubernetes multi-cluster platform. Second, define load policies (such as priority or regional preferences). Third, deploy workloads through CI/CD pipelines. Finally, continuously monitor performance and adjust resources. Business values include improved disaster recovery capabilities, optimized operational costs, and accelerated innovation."
