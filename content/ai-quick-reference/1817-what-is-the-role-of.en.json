  "content": "Container orchestration is the core technology for automating the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containerized applications. It is crucial in cloud-native development for managing the lifecycle of large-scale, complex microservices applications, enabling environmental consistency, rapid iteration, and elastic scaling. This technology serves as the cornerstone supporting DevOps and continuous delivery.\n\nThe core functions of container orchestration include scheduling (automatically selecting appropriate nodes to run containers), service discovery and load balancing (managing inter-container communication and traffic distribution), auto-scaling (increasing or decreasing instances based on metrics), self-healing (automatically restarting or replacing containers upon failure), configuration and secret management, and declarative API for defining target states. By abstracting the details of underlying infrastructure, it allows developers to focus on the applications themselves, significantly improving deployment density, resource utilization, and operational efficiency, and greatly advancing the implementation of microservices architectures.\n\nContainer orchestration accelerates application delivery speed and frequency through automated operational processes, supporting agile development. It ensures continuous high availability of applications, allowing services to remain externally accessible even if some nodes or containers fail. Optimized resource scheduling substantially reduces infrastructure costs. Its declarative configuration drives efficient collaboration between development and operations, serving as the fundamental technical guarantee for realizing the core values of cloud-native (agility, elasticity, observability, resilience)."
