Cloud-native environment is an architecture approach based on cloud computing, which uses containerization technology to encapsulate applications, enabling lightweight and portable application delivery. Its importance lies in supporting high availability and elastic scaling, with application scenarios including deploying and maintaining multiple microservice applications in distributed systems.

The core components include container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, which automates the deployment, scaling, and self-healing of containerized applications. Through dynamic resource scheduling and network management, the system ensures the collaborative work among multiple applications, and the practical impact is simplifying operation and maintenance processes and improving application reliability and efficiency.

The implementation steps start with defining Kubernetes manifests to deploy applications and integrating CI/CD tools to achieve automatic updates. A typical scenario is running multi-tenant services on the cloud; business values include reducing infrastructure costs, enhancing elasticity, and accelerating delivery cycles.
