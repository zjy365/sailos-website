Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure setup using code, essential for reliability and scalability in interconnected service deployments like microservices. Its importance lies in reducing manual errors and enabling consistent cloud environments.

Key components include modular templates for each service, version control via Git, and CI/CD pipelines. Features involve declarative definitions and service dependencies managed through tools like Terraform or Kubernetes manifests. This minimizes downtime and supports distributed team collaboration in cloud-native settings.

Implement by: 1. Modularize services for reusability. 2. Version control IaC in Git repositories. 3. Integrate CI/CD for automated testing and deployment. 4. Monitor with observability tools. Business value includes accelerated releases and cost savings via efficient resource management.
