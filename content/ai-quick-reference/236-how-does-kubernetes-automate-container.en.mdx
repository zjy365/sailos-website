Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that simplifies the operation of the application lifecycle by automating container deployment, scaling, and management. Its importance lies in improving efficiency, ensuring high availability and elasticity, making it suitable for cloud-native environments such as microservice architectures, handling dynamic load changes, supporting rolling updates, and other scenarios.

It is core-based on control loops and declarative configuration: users define the desired state (such as Deployment or ReplicaSet), the controller manager monitors and schedules Pods to nodes, and integrates Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to monitor resource metrics and automatically adjust the number of replicas. Features include service discovery, self-healing mechanisms, and load balancing. In practical applications, it has driven DevOps automation, optimized resource utilization, achieved zero-downtime deployment, reduced costs for cloud computing, and enhanced scalability.

Implementation steps: Define YAML to describe application requirements, deploy controllers to manage the Pod lifecycle; configure HPA rules (such as CPU thresholds) for automatic scaling. Typical scenarios handle traffic peaks; business values include reducing operational burden, improving response speed, ensuring service elasticity, and supporting agile business growth.
