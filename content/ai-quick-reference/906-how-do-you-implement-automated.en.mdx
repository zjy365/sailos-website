Implementing automated security checks in a cloud-native CI/CD pipeline refers to integrating security tools into the continuous integration and deployment process to automatically identify vulnerabilities and ensure application security. Its importance lies in preventing security risks such as code injection or container vulnerabilities, and it is applicable to cloud-native applications such as containerized and microservice architecture-based financial services or e-commerce, to enhance compliance and reduce the attack surface.

Core components include Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to scan code repositories, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to analyze runtime, and container security scanning tools such as Trivy or Clair to check image vulnerabilities. The principle is to automatically trigger scans based on policies during CI/CD phases (e.g., before building or deployment). The impact is reducing manual audits, improving the overall security posture in the Kubernetes deployment process, and enhancing the DevSecOps culture.

Implementation steps: 1. Integrate security tools such as SonarQube or Snyk into CI/CD platforms such as Jenkins or GitLab CI. 2. Define scanning policies (e.g., vulnerability severity thresholds). 3. Add automated scanning tasks in pipeline scripts (for example, running SAST during the build phase and performing container scanning before deployment). 4. Set failure conditions (e.g., aborting the process when high-risk vulnerabilities are detected). Typical scenarios include automatically checking for vulnerabilities during image building. The business value is accelerating releases while ensuring security compliance and reducing costs.
