  "content": "Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a mechanism for managing user and group access to Kubernetes resources, ensuring secure access to containerized applications in cloud-native environments. It实现细粒度权限控制 through roles and bindings, supporting multi-tenant scenarios such as team isolation and API server security.\n\nThe core components of RBAC include Roles (permission definitions within a namespace) and ClusterRoles (cluster-wide scope), which grant permissions to users or groups through RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings. For example, a read-only role can be defined to restrict access to a specific namespace. In practical applications, it assigns permissions to development teams limited to the dev namespace, reducing cross-environment interference and improving overall security and compliance.\n\nThe implementation steps are: first create a role to define permissions (such as verbs: get), then bind it to a user/group. A typical scenario is that the development team only manages deployments in the dev namespace, and the business value includes enhancing security, reducing the risk of misoperation, and meeting audit requirements."
