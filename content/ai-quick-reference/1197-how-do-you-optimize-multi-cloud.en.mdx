Optimizing multi-cloud infrastructure refers to adjusting resource deployment across multiple cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) to minimize expenditure waste. Its importance lies in avoiding overbilling and improving budget utilization. Application scenarios include enterprise workload distribution and cloud-native architectures, ensuring cost efficiency while maintaining high availability.

Core components include cost monitoring tools (e.g., CloudHealth), automated resource scheduling, and load balancing strategies. The principle is to eliminate idle resources through continuous analysis of usage data, characterized by flexibility and scalability. In practical applications, Kubernetes orchestrator is combined to manage multi-cloud deployments, with impacts including a 20%-30% reduction in unnecessary expenses and enhanced ROI.

Implementation steps: 1. Audit existing cloud usage and cost gaps. 2. Deploy management platforms (such as Terraform) for automated monitoring and scaling. 3. Apply AI-driven load balancing strategies to optimize resource allocation. Typical scenarios include dynamic migration to low-cost regions. Business values include significant cost savings, improved operational efficiency, and support for agile business growth.
