Infrastructure as Code (IaC) uses code to define and manage infrastructure resources, enabling automated configuration. It is crucial because it ensures consistency, repeatability, and reliability across development, testing, and production environments, applied in cloud computing and Kubernetes deployment scenarios such as preventing environment drift and accelerating software releases.

The core components of IaC include declarative code files (e.g., Terraform or Ansible), version control tools (e.g., Git), and automation engines (e.g., CI/CD pipelines). Its characteristics are versionability, self-descriptiveness, and automated deployment. The principle is to template infrastructure states and uniformly apply them to all environments, eliminating manual configuration differences. This improves reliability and efficiency, and reduces environment-related failures.

Implementation steps include: defining infrastructure code templates; incorporating version control systems; integrating automation tools to deploy to all environments; testing and verifying consistency. Typical scenarios include synchronizing Kubernetes cluster configurations. Business values are accelerating development cycles, reducing defect rates, and lowering operational costs.
