In a multi-cloud Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environment, security ensures that resources automatically deployed through code are consistently compliant across multi-cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), reducing the risk of configuration errors and the attack surface, and is suitable for dynamically scalable cloud-native applications. Its core includes code version control (e.g., Git), secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), policy as code (e.g., Open Policy Agent), and continuous auditing tools, embedding security policies into CI/CD pipelines. Through unified multi-cloud management, compliance and resource traceability are enhanced.

Practical implementation steps include: 1. Integrating secrets management tools to avoid hard-coded credentials; 2. Defining policy-as-code rules to automatically check resource compliance; 3. Unifying audit logs and tools to monitor configuration deviations in real-time; 4. Incorporating security scans (e.g., Terrascan) into CI/CD. Business-wise, it can reduce the risk of data breaches, ensure compliance requirements, and accelerate secure deployments.
