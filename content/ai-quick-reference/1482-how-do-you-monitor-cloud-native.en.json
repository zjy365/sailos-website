  "content": "Serverless architecture allows developers to avoid managing servers, with cloud providers dynamically allocating resources. Performance monitoring ensures the high reliability and elastic scalability of cloud-native applications, making it suitable for microservices and event-driven scenarios.\n\nThe monitoring core includes log collection (such as function execution details), performance metrics (such as latency and error rates), and distributed tracing. Data is integrated through cloud services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) or tools (e.g., Prometheus) to achieve real-time insights and improve operational efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Configure function-level log export to the monitoring system; 2. Set up dashboards to visualize performance metrics; 3. Define alert rules to respond to anomalies. The business value lies in reducing operational costs, shortening fault response time, and enhancing user experience."
