Ensuring data privacy and security for cloud-native machine learning applications is crucial to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Cloud-native applications leverage containerization and Kubernetes for elastic deployment, processing sensitive data in AI scenarios such as medical analysis.

Core components include data encryption (in transit/at rest), role-based access control (RBAC), microservice isolation, secret management tools (e.g., K8s Secrets), and audit logs. In practical applications, integrating these into orchestration can reduce the attack surface, protect model training data and user privacy, while complying with regulations like GDPR.

Implementation steps: 1. Encrypt all data flows and storage; 2. Apply least privilege access policies; 3. Securely store confidential information; 4. Enable real-time monitoring and compliance auditing; 5. Continuously update security patches. The business value is enhancing customer trust, ensuring compliance, and promoting the secure application of AI-driven innovation in cloud environments.
