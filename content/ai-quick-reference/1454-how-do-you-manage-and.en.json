  "content": "In a distributed microservices architecture, log management involves centrally collecting and analyzing scattered service logs to ensure system observability. Its importance lies in simplifying troubleshooting, monitoring performance deviations, and ensuring high availability. Application scenarios include real-time debugging and compliance auditing in cloud-native environments.\n\nThe core components include log collection agents (such as Fluentd or Promtail), aggregation systems (such as ELK Stack or Loki), and visualization tools (such as Kibana). Features encompass distributed processing, real-time storage, and elastic scalability. In practical applications, these components support tracking request flows across services, significantly improving operational efficiency and reducing system downtime.\n\nImplementation steps: First, deploy lightweight agents to microservice instances to collect logs; second, configure log streams to a central platform for aggregation and storage; finally, establish indexes and dashboards for querying and alerting. A typical scenario is using the EFK Stack in Kubernetes clusters. Business values include accelerating fault response, reducing operational costs, and supporting continuous delivery processes."
