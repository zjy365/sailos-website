Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or service, and authorization is the granting of permissions to access resources. In cloud-native security, these two mechanisms are crucial for preventing unauthorized access. They are commonly used in the protection of Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications to ensure the overall security of the system.

The core components of authentication include identity verification (such as token-based, certificate-based, or multi-factor authentication), whose principle is to confirm the identity of an entity; authorization involves permission policies (such as role-based access control), whose principle is to assign resource operation rights based on identity. In practical applications, in Kubernetes, OpenID Connect handles authentication, and RBAC manages authorization, distinguishing between user and resource permissions and enhancing the credibility of microservice interactions.

Authentication ensures the authenticity of identity, and authorization defines the scope of operations; the difference between the two is that the former verifies ""who you are"" and the latter determines ""what you can do"". In cloud-native environments, this separation provides fine-grained access control, improves security compliance, and reduces the risk of data leakage.
