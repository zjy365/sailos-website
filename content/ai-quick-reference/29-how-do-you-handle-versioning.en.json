  "content": "In cloud-native environments, version control refers to the practice of managing changes to artifacts such as container images, application configurations, and infrastructure as code, ensuring deployment consistency and traceability. Its importance lies in supporting continuous integration/continuous deployment, rapid rollbacks, multi-environment management, and compliance auditing. Core application scenarios include independent microservice releases, configuration drift prevention, and infrastructure change tracking.\n\nCore components include container image tag management, versioned configuration storage, and declarative deployment manifest management. Container images are uniquely identified using semantic versioning or commit hashes and stored in image registries. Configuration files, Helm Charts, Kustomize overlays, or Terraform code manage change histories through version control systems like Git. Deployment tools rely on this versioned information to achieve precise description and replication of environments. These practices ensure change controllability and significantly reduce the risks of multi-service coordination and canary releases.\n\nImplementation steps: 1) CI/CD pipelines build container images and generate unique version tags; 2) Store application configurations, deployment manifests, and infrastructure definitions in Git repositories for version control; 3) Use GitOps tools to monitor repository changes and automatically sync them to clusters. Typical scenarios include rolling back to an older image version to fix production issues or performing blue-green deployments by modifying manifest versions. Business value is reflected in improved deployment reliability, shortened fault recovery time, and meeting change auditing requirements."
