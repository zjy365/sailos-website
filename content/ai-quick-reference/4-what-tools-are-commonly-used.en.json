  "content": "Cloud-native development environment refers to the method of building applications on cloud computing platforms using containerization, microservices, and automation technologies. Its importance lies in enhancing development agility, scalability, and reliability, and it is suitable for scenarios such as microservice architecture and cloud platform deployment.\n\nCore tools include containerization tools like Docker, orchestration tools like Kubernetes, monitoring tools like Prometheus, and CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI. They support automated deployment, high availability, and observability. In practical applications, they accelerate development iterations, improve system resilience, and promote DevOps practices.\n\nThe application of these tools enables rapid release and continuous delivery, whose value lies in reducing deployment risks, enhancing team collaboration, and optimizing resource utilization."
