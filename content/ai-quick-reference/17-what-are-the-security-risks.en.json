  "content": "Cloud-native development environments leverage containerization, Kubernetes, and other technologies to enable agile development but face unique security challenges. Their importance lies in protecting distributed applications from threats, ensuring data privacy and system stability, with wide application in microservice deployment scenarios.\n\nCore risks include container escape attacks, image supply chain vulnerabilities, Kubernetes configuration errors, and API exposure risks. These stem from the dynamic nature of the environment and may lead to data breaches, service disruptions, or compliance issues, severely impacting business continuity.\n\nAfter identifying such risks, measures like image scanning, security policies, and access control can reduce the incidence of threats and enhance the environment's reliability and compliance value."
