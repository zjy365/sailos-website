In a heterogeneous environment, microservice interoperability ensures seamless interaction between diverse systems (such as different languages and frameworks), which is crucial for cloud-native applications, supporting hybrid cloud and multi-language deployment scenarios and improving overall integration efficiency.

Its core components include API standardization (e.g., RESTful or gRPC), service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Consul), and message queues (e.g., Kafka). In practice, service meshes (e.g., Istio) provide communication guarantees to achieve secure and reliable cross-system calls, thereby enhancing flexibility, simplifying maintenance, and reducing the impact of vendor lock-in.

Implementation steps include: defining unified API standards (e.g., OpenAPI); deploying an API gateway as the entry point; integrating a service registry for discovery; and applying a service mesh to handle network policies. Typical business values are improving development agility, reducing integration costs, and facilitating environment scaling.
