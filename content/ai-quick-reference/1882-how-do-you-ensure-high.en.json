  "content": "Cloud-native applications are containerized applications designed and run in cloud environments. High availability refers to the ability of a system to continuously operate normally, ensuring minimal service interruptions. Its importance lies in supporting the 24/7 operation of critical businesses such as e-commerce and financial systems, enhancing user trust and business continuity.\n\nThe core components include replica redundancy, automatic failover, and health monitoring. The principle is based on Kubernetes' self-healing capability, managing Pod replica sets through Deployments and configuring Liveness/Readiness probes. In practical applications, reducing single points of failure and enhancing cross-regional disaster recovery capabilities significantly improve system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Deploy multiple replicas to ensure redundancy; 2. Configure health checks to automatically restart failed instances; 3. Distribute across availability zones or cloud regions. Typical scenarios include load-balanced applications, with business value in optimizing user experience, reducing downtime losses, and supporting elastic scaling."
