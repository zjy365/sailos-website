  "content": "CI/CD pipelines automate software building, testing, and deployment, while monitoring tools track application performance and errors in real-time. Integrating the two is crucial, as it provides automatic feedback to improve reliability, reduce downtime, and is suitable for cloud-native deployments to achieve continuous optimization.\n\nCore components include CI/CD stages (build, test, deploy) and monitoring metrics (such as logs, response time). Through API or Webhook integration, monitoring checks are triggered after deployment, collecting data to drive iterations; this enhances DevOps processes, improves deployment quality, and impacts observability.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Add monitoring scripts as post-deployment steps in CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins or GitHub Actions). 2. Call monitoring APIs (e.g., Prometheus or Datadog) to collect metrics and set alert rules. 3. Automatically verify health status. Business value: Reduces downtime risks, shortens fault recovery time, and supports SRE practices to optimize operational efficiency."
