Fault-tolerant cloud-native architecture refers to the ability to design systems in a cloud-native environment to cope with failures, and application elasticity ensures that services automatically resume operation under interference. Its importance lies in improving application availability and business continuity, applicable to high-reliability scenarios such as e-commerce and finance, reducing losses caused by downtime.

Core features include distributed microservices architecture, automatic fault detection and recovery mechanisms (such as ReplicaSets in Kubernetes), and service meshes (such as Istio) to implement traffic control. Through health checks and rolling update principles, the system can seamlessly handle node or component failures. The impacts include enhancing system resilience, reducing human intervention, and improving the fault tolerance of cloud-native applications.

Implementation steps: First, deploy redundant resources such as multiple replica Pods; second, configure liveness probes and automatic scaling policies; finally, integrate message queues to implement asynchronous processing. Typical business values include optimizing resource utilization, reducing costs and increasing efficiency, ensuring continuous services, and improving user satisfaction.
