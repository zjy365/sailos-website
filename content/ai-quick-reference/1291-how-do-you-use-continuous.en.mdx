Continuous Delivery is a software practice that ensures code changes are ready for release to the production environment at any time through automated testing, building, and deployment processes. Its importance lies in reducing manual operations and errors, significantly accelerating software delivery speed. Application scenarios include agile development and cloud-native project development, directly shortening the product time-to-market cycle.

The core components include automated testing, continuous integration, deployment pipelines, and infrastructure as code. Its characteristics are frequent, reliable small-scale releases, which reduce risks and improve software quality through rapid feedback loops. In practical applications, CD enhances DevOps collaboration, reduces deployment time, improves reliability and team efficiency, thereby accelerating product iteration.

Implementation steps include automated test coverage, setting up CI/CD pipelines (such as using Jenkins or GitLab CI), version control, and canary releases. In typical scenarios, after code submission, it is automatically built, tested, and deployed to the production environment. Business value is reflected in quickly responding to market demands, reducing time-to-market delays, enhancing competitiveness, and optimizing customer experience.
