  "content": "Managing microservices across multiple Kubernetes clusters involves coordinating service deployment and communication across independent clusters to ensure high availability, disaster recovery capabilities, and geographically distributed performance. Its importance lies in supporting multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments, adapting to global deployment and business continuity needs, such as应对区域性故障 or optimizing user access latency.\n\nCore components include Kubernetes multi-cluster management tools (e.g., KubeFed, Cluster API), service meshes (e.g., Istio), and API gateways. Features involve automatic service discovery, load balancing, security policy enforcement, and service monitoring. These mechanisms enable seamless connectivity for microservices during cross-cluster calls, simplifying governance, unifying configurations, and enhancing resilience in practical applications, thereby significantly improving system operational efficiency.\n\nImplementation steps: First, federate clusters using tools like KubeFed; second, deploy a service mesh to manage communication and policies; finally, configure an API gateway to expose external entry points. This process delivers business value in typical scenarios such as disaster recovery or load balancing: enhancing resilience, reducing latency, and lowering cross-environment operational costs."
