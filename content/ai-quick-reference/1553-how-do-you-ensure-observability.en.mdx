In a cloud-native environment, observability refers to the ability to real-time monitor the status of various application layers through logs, metrics, and traces. Its importance lies in quickly detecting faults, ensuring system reliability, and optimizing performance, which is applicable to debugging and SLA management in microservice architectures.

Core components include monitoring tools (such as Prometheus for collecting metrics), logging systems (such as Fluentd for processing logs), and tracing frameworks (such as Jaeger for recording service calls). Features involve data correlation, low-latency alerts, and end-to-end visibility. Practical applications require integrating the OpenTelemetry standard and achieving full-stack observability through service meshes (such as Istio) to improve operational efficiency.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy a unified collector agent to standardize data; 2. Configure cross-layer tracing and alert rules; 3. Analyze data on dashboards such as Grafana. Business values include shortening MTTR and improving user experience, typically ensuring availability in e-commerce transaction flows.
