Debugging and troubleshooting of cloud-native applications refer to the process of identifying and diagnosing application issues in containerized and distributed environments. Its importance lies in ensuring high availability, scalability, and rapid iteration, applied in microservice deployment scenarios within Kubernetes clusters, such as continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

The core components include log aggregation (e.g., ELK Stack), metrics monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger), and service mesh (e.g., Istio). It is characterized by high observability and automated repair capabilities. In practical applications, these tools help quickly locate performance bottlenecks or service failures, improve system reliability, and reduce downtime risks in dynamically scaling environments.

Implementation steps: 1. Deploy centralized logging tools to collect container logs; 2. Configure metrics monitoring systems for real-time alerts; 3. Integrate tracing tools to analyze request flows; 4. Use service mesh to isolate fault points. Typical scenarios include handling interruptions during rolling updates or network latency issues. Business values include reducing mean time to repair (MTTR), optimizing resource utilization, and enhancing user experience.
