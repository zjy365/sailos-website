Cloud-native development leverages core features such as containerization, microservices, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and dynamic orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) to significantly optimize Continuous Integration (CI) processes. Through standardized environments, automated infrastructure management, and loosely coupled service design, it shortens the integration feedback cycle and serves as a key practice for agile teams to deliver software quickly and reliably.

At its core: containerization (Docker images) provides consistent build, test, and runtime environments, eliminating the ""environment discrepancy"" issue; Kubernetes orchestration automates deployment, scaling, and rollbacks; Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) ensures environment repeatability and versioning; service meshes (e.g., Istio) enable observability and governance of inter-service communication. These features collectively enable automated CI pipelines: code commits trigger image builds, automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) run in isolated environments, and rapid deployment to staging or production environments via pipelines, greatly increasing integration frequency and deployment reliability.

Typical team implementation steps include: 1) Adopting GitOps practices to codify and version-control infrastructure and application configurations; 2) Building pipelines based on container definitions; 3) Embedding comprehensive automated test suites within pipelines; 4) Using Kubernetes to implement progressive releases (e.g., canary deployments). The core business values delivered include accelerated iteration speed, reduced deployment risks, improved software quality, and efficient fault isolation and recovery capabilities.
