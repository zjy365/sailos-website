A cross-regional cloud-native application refers to a containerized microservices application deployed across multiple geographical regions to ensure high performance and high availability. Its importance lies in reducing user latency, supporting business continuity and disaster recovery, and it is applied in scenarios such as global e-commerce or financial services.

Core components include Kubernetes multi-cluster management, service meshes like Istio for optimizing traffic routing, and monitoring stacks such as Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection. Region-aware load balancing and data synchronization mechanisms ensure failover and real-time tracking, with impacts including improved response time and system resilience, optimizing real-time applications such as financial transactions.

Implementation steps include: 1. Configure Kubernetes federation or cross-regional clusters; 2. Deploy service mesh and set up global load balancing; 3. Integrate monitoring tools to achieve log and metrics visualization; 4. Optimize network such as using Cloud CDN. A typical scenario is a global e-commerce platform, with business value including 50% reduction in latency, improved user satisfaction, and cost efficiency.
