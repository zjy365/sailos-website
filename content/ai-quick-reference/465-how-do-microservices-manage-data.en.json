  "content": "Microservices architecture splits an application into independently deployable small services, each managing its own data storage. This approach enhances scalability, resilience, and development agility, widely used in distributed systems such as e-commerce and financial services to support rapid iteration and fault isolation.\n\nThe core lies in the \"\"database per service\"\" principle, ensuring data isolation and loose coupling. Features include service-specific databases (e.g., SQL or NoSQL), data access via API interfaces, and asynchronous communication mechanisms (such as event-driven or CQRS patterns) to coordinate consistency. In practice, this reduces global bottlenecks but increases the challenge of distributed transactions, with impacts including optimized query performance and maintaining data integrity through message queues.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Allocate a dedicated database instance for each microservice. 2. Design REST/gRPC APIs to handle retrieval requests. 3. Adopt Saga patterns or event sourcing to manage cross-service transactions. 4. Use API gateways to aggregate cross-domain queries. Business values include improved data autonomy, response speed, and system resilience, supporting elastic scaling and technology stack diversification."
