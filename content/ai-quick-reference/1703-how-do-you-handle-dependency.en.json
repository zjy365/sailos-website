  "content": "IaC automates infrastructure management using code, with the key focus on handling interdependencies between services, such as startup sequences and configuration sharing, to ensure high reliability and consistency in cloud-native environments, especially avoiding deployment conflicts in microservices architectures.\n\nThe core lies in tools like Terraform or Kubernetes manifests, which use declarative syntax to define resource relationships (e.g., explicit DependsOn attributes), automatically orchestrate dependency logic, reduce manual intervention, improve efficiency and auditability, and are suitable for CI/CD pipelines.\n\nImplementation steps: 1. Define resources and specify dependencies (e.g., Service A depends on Database B); 2. Use orchestration tools to verify the sequence; 3. Integrate automated deployment; 4. Conduct continuous testing. Business value includes accelerating deployment cycles, reducing error risks, and optimizing resource utilization."
