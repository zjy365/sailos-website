  "content": "The Kubernetes security context is a mechanism used to define security parameters (such as user IDs, file permissions) for Pods or containers, and is crucial in protecting cloud-native applications. It prevents unauthorized access and data leakage, applies to scenarios such as multi-tenant clusters and sensitive data processing, and ensures the isolation of applications in shared environments.\n\nThe core components of a security context include setting runAsNonRoot (non-privileged user), read-only file system mode, and SELinux context. Its characteristic is that it can be configured at the Pod or container level to enforce the principle of least privilege. In practical applications, it significantly reduces security risks by restricting container operations (such as preventing privilege escalation attacks). The impacts include enhancing the overall defense capabilities of Kubernetes, supporting industry compliance requirements, and promoting best practices for cloud-native architectures.\n\nThe application in protecting cloud-native applications is to reduce the attack surface and automate security controls. The value is reflected in improving system isolation, ensuring data confidentiality, and achieving more reliable enterprise-level security operations by simplifying compliance processes."
