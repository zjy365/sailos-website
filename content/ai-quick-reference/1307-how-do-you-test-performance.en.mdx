Load testing is a key practice for evaluating the performance of cloud applications under high concurrency pressure, ensuring they meet performance SLAs after deployment in the CI/CD pipeline. This is crucial for scenarios such as e-commerce promotions and traffic peaks, as it can identify scaling bottlenecks, resource shortages, and functional failures in advance to prevent production environment crashes.

The core components include selecting appropriate load testing tools, configuring a test environment close to production, defining realistic user behavior scenarios, continuously executing tests, and monitoring key metrics. Testing tools need to be automatically triggered in CI/CD to simulate user requests and monitor application response time, throughput, error rate, and resource consumption. Result analysis provides baseline comparisons, identifies performance bottlenecks, and feeds reports back into the CI/CD process as a basis for deciding whether a version can be released.

Implementation steps are: 1. Select integrated testing tools and write performance test scripts; 2. Deploy a consistent environment; 3. Integrate load testing into the CI/CD pipeline for automatic triggering before or after deployment; 4. Collect and analyze results, and automatically verify performance based on thresholds or mark build failures/manual reviews. This ensures performance reliability after each change, reduces the risk of online failures, and optimizes user experience.
