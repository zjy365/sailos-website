Hybrid cloud optimizes the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of data analytics applications by combining public and private cloud resources. Its importance lies in supporting large-scale data processing while ensuring compliance and security; application scenarios include real-time analytics, machine learning model training, and adherence to data privacy regulations (such as GDPR).

Core components include public cloud (e.g., AWS S3), private cloud (e.g., on-premises Kubernetes clusters), hybrid connectivity (e.g., VPN or dedicated lines), and unified management platforms. Features encompass elastic scaling, data sovereignty, and unified monitoring. In practice, data analytics applications can deploy the computing layer on the public cloud for efficient data processing while keeping sensitive raw data in the private cloud; this model enhances processing capacity, reduces latency, and enables rapid decision-making.

Implementation steps: 1. Assess data requirements and compliance needs. 2. Design the hybrid architecture, select cloud services, and integrate tools (e.g., Spark or Hadoop). 3. Deploy secure connections, deploy applications, and optimize performance. 4. Continuously monitor and adjust. A typical scenario involves batch processing running on the cloud and real-time analytics on-premises; business values include reducing operating costs by 30-50%, accelerating insight extraction, and enhancing data protection.
