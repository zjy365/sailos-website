Automated data lifecycle management in cloud-native environments refers to policy-driven automated processes for data from creation to archiving, integrating containers, microservices, and cloud services. Its importance lies in improving data efficiency, ensuring security and compliance (such as GDPR), and it is suitable for data-intensive applications like AI pipelines and real-time analytics systems.

Core components include policy definition engines, data classification tools, storage tiering (e.g., object storage), and automated workflows (implemented through Kubernetes CRDs and operators). Features include API-driven, scalability, and integration with cloud-native tools (e.g., Velero). In practical applications, Kubernetes operators automatically perform backups and deletions, optimizing resource usage and reducing operational costs.

Implementation steps: 1. Define data policies (e.g., retention periods); 2. Integrate tiered storage (e.g., S3); 3. Deploy automation controllers (e.g., Velero CR); 4. Monitor and conduct compliance checks. Typical scenarios include automatically archiving cold data to low-cost storage, with business values of reducing manual errors, optimizing storage costs by over 30%, and accelerating compliance audits.
