  "content": "Team collaboration is crucial in microservices architecture, as it avoids silos, ensures stable system integration, and is applied in distributed scenarios such as e-commerce and finance. Its importance lies in independent development while requiring overall consistency.\n\nThe core includes standardized API contracts, service discovery mechanisms, and event-driven design, with features like loose coupling to enhance autonomy. In practical applications, shared contracts and toolchains (such as Kubernetes service mesh) are adopted to improve team coordination, accelerate iteration, and enhance system resilience.\n\nImplementation steps include: defining clear API interface documents; unifying communication protocols (such as REST or gRPC); performing contract testing to verify compatibility; leveraging shared platforms (such as Istio); and conducting regular cross-team reviews and integration testing. The business value lies in shortening delivery cycles and reducing the risk of conflicts."
