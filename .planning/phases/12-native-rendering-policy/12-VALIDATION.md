# Phase 12 Validation Scaffold: Native Rendering Policy

**Created:** 2026-06-12  
**Updated:** 2026-06-12 by `12-03-PLAN.md`
**Scope:** Planning scaffold for Phase 12 `Native Rendering Policy`  
**Goal:** Users can receive stable OG and blog thumbnail images from pre-generated or cache-keyed render paths with verified native dependency assumptions.

## Plan Split

| Plan | Wave | Requirements | Objective | Dependencies |
|------|------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| `12-01-PLAN.md` | 1 | `NATIVE-01` | Create source-owned native rendering policy, docs, source guard, tests, npm command, and validation scaffold. | none |
| `12-02-PLAN.md` | 2 | `NATIVE-01`, `NATIVE-02` | Extract reusable render/font/cache-key helpers, preserve route behavior, and add gated local fixture benchmark. | `12-01` |
| `12-03-PLAN.md` | 3 | `NATIVE-03` | Compose Docker/native validation, static-output/route-policy alignment, audit traceability, and Phase 13 handoff. | `12-01`, `12-02` |

## 12-01 Source Validation Status

| Artifact | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `config/native-rendering-policy.json` | IMPLEMENTED | Defines homepage OG WebP plus blog SVG/PNG surfaces, renderer/template/font tokens, accepted formats, dimensions, DPR caps, cache-key fields, route-policy alignment, and validation commands. |
| `docs/native-rendering-policy.md` | IMPLEMENTED | Mirrors the machine policy and names static artifact ownership, runtime cache semantics, accepted formats, font contract, native dependency assumptions, Phase 9, Phase 10, and Phase 13 boundaries. |
| `scripts/check-native-rendering-policy.js` | IMPLEMENTED | Exports `validateNativeRenderingPolicy`, `validateNativePolicyConfig`, `validateNativeEnvironmentCaveats`, `validateNativeRoutePolicyAlignment`, `validateNativeFontContract`, and `printNativeRenderingPolicySummary`. |
| `scripts/check-native-rendering-policy.test.mjs` | IMPLEMENTED | Covers repository PASS plus fail-closed fixture cases for missing rows, invalid cache-key dimensions, route ownership drift, missing font rows, validation command drift, and current-shell caveats. |
| `package.json` | IMPLEMENTED | Adds `native-rendering:check` as `node scripts/check-native-rendering-policy.js` while preserving existing scripts from earlier phases. |

## 12-02 Helper And Benchmark Validation Status

| Artifact | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `lib/native-rendering/cache-key.ts` | IMPLEMENTED | Exports `buildNativeImageCacheKey` with ordered image type, language, slug, dimensions, DPR, format, renderer version, template version, and font version tokens. |
| `lib/native-rendering/fonts.ts` | IMPLEMENTED | Exports memoized `getNativeRenderFonts`, `getNativeRenderFontStatus`, exact font byte contracts, and canvas font registration metadata. |
| `lib/native-rendering/og-renderer.ts` | IMPLEMENTED | Exports `renderOgPngBuffer`, `renderOgWebpBuffer`, 1200x630 metadata, WebP quality 90, and cache-key metadata. |
| `lib/native-rendering/blog-thumbnail-renderer.tsx` | IMPLEMENTED | Exports format parsing, static params, page resolution, Satori SVG rendering, and gated `ImageResponse` PNG rendering helpers. |
| `app/api/og/route.ts` | IMPLEMENTED | Thin adapter over `renderOgWebpBuffer()` preserving `Content-Type: image/webp`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`, and JSON 500 error shape. |
| `app/api/blog/[lang]/[slug]/thumbnail/[format]/route.ts` | IMPLEMENTED | Thin adapter over shared parse/static-param/render helpers preserving invalid format 400, missing post 404, SVG content type, PNG `ImageResponse`, language fallback, and slug decoding. |
| `scripts/benchmark-native-rendering.js` | IMPLEMENTED | Closed gate exits 0 with `SKIPPED_WITH_CAVEAT`; open gate reports `BLOCKED` and exits 1 when Node 20/native prerequisites are missing. |
| `scripts/benchmark-native-rendering.test.mjs` | IMPLEMENTED | Covers environment context, closed gate, open blocked gate, and injected renderer D-12 result rows. |
| `package.json` | IMPLEMENTED | Adds `native-rendering:benchmark` as `node scripts/benchmark-native-rendering.js` while preserving previous scripts. |

## NATIVE-02 Coverage

| Truth | Source Evidence | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Developer can benchmark OG and thumbnail rendering with local fixtures under Node 20. | `scripts/benchmark-native-rendering.js` defines local homepage OG and blog thumbnail SVG/PNG fixtures plus `PHASE12_RUN_NATIVE_BENCHMARK` acceptance gate. | GATED READY |
| Benchmark output reports renderer, fixture key, format, dimensions, DPR, font cache state, duration, output bytes, status, and caveats. | `scripts/benchmark-native-rendering.test.mjs` verifies injected result rows contain the D-12 schema. | SOURCE-GUARDED |
| Default benchmark avoids native imports in the current shell. | Closed gate path returns `SKIPPED_WITH_CAVEAT` and tests assert injected native importer is unused. | SOURCE-GUARDED |
| Open benchmark fails closed without Node 20/native prerequisites. | Wrapper command expects nonzero output containing `BLOCKED` while active Node is v24 and `node_modules`, `.source`, and `out` are absent. | BLOCKED AS EXPECTED |

## NATIVE-01 Coverage

| Truth | Source Evidence | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| User can receive stable OG and blog thumbnail images from pre-generated or cache-keyed render paths. | Policy rows declare deterministic source artifacts in `public/generated/native-images`, static-export output in `out/generated/native-images`, and runtime cache-key dimensions for dynamic variants. | SOURCE-POLICY READY |
| Runtime routes and unversioned compatibility URLs use explicit cache headers. | Policy and docs keep `public, max-age=86400` for runtime routes and compatibility URLs. | SOURCE-POLICY READY |
| Longer immutable caching is restricted to versioned artifact URLs. | Policy and docs reserve immutable caching for fully versioned static artifact URLs. | SOURCE-POLICY READY |
| Phase 10 route ownership remains aligned. | Guard checks `/api/og` and `/api/blog/:lang/:slug/thumbnail/:format` are `runtime native route` rows owned by `phase-12-native-rendering`. | SOURCE-GUARDED |

## NATIVE-03 Coverage

| Truth | Source Evidence | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Developer can verify Docker native library assumptions before deployment. | `scripts/smoke-docker-nginx.js` checks Dockerfile tokens for `node:20-bookworm-slim`, native image library packages, `npm ci && npm run build`, `/app/out`, and `/usr/share/nginx/html`. | SOURCE-GUARDED |
| Docker smoke composes native renderer source and gated benchmark checks. | Docker smoke plan includes `npm run native-rendering:check` and `npm run native-rendering:benchmark` inside the open `PHASE9_RUN_DOCKER_SMOKE` plan. | GATED READY |
| Deployment validation includes the native source guard by default. | `npm run validate:deployment` runs `npm run native-rendering:check` between `app-store:diff` and `static-output:check`. | SOURCE-GUARDED |
| Static-output validation reports native artifact status. | `scripts/check-static-output.js` reads `config/native-rendering-policy.json` and checks `public/generated/native-images` plus `out/generated/native-images` only when those artifacts or `out` exist. | SOURCE-GUARDED |
| Route-policy validation keeps native routes owned by Phase 12. | `scripts/check-static-export-routes.js` validates native image surfaces against `/api/og` and `/api/blog/:lang/:slug/thumbnail/:format` route rows owned by `phase-12-native-rendering`. | SOURCE-GUARDED |

## Environment Caveats

| Check | Current State | Acceptance Meaning |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|
| Active Node | `v24.13.0` | Source checks may run; accepted native timing evidence requires Node 20 from `.nvmrc`. |
| `.nvmrc` | `20` | Locked benchmark and deployment evidence must use Node 20. |
| `node_modules` | absent | Native imports and renderer timing are blocked until locked dependencies are installed. |
| `.source` | absent | Fumadocs-backed runtime route execution remains caveated in this shell. |
| `out` | absent | Static artifact inspection remains `SKIPPED_WITH_CAVEAT` until a locked build creates output. |
| Docker CLI | unavailable | Docker/Nginx native validation remains blocked until the gate runs in a Docker-capable environment. |

## Final Phase 12 Command Results

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `node --test scripts/check-native-rendering-policy.test.mjs scripts/benchmark-native-rendering.test.mjs scripts/smoke-docker-nginx.test.mjs scripts/check-deployment-parity.test.mjs scripts/check-static-output.test.mjs scripts/check-static-export-routes.test.mjs` | PASS | 43 tests passed across native policy, benchmark, Docker smoke, deployment parity, static-output, and route-policy suites. |
| `npm run native-rendering:check` | PASS_WITH_CAVEATS | Policy rows 4, route policy alignment PASS, font contract PASS, package script PASS, environment `PASS_WITH_CAVEATS` for Node v24 vs `.nvmrc` 20, absent `node_modules`, absent `.source`, absent `out`, and unavailable Docker CLI. |
| `npm run native-rendering:benchmark` | PASS_WITH_CAVEAT | Closed `PHASE12_RUN_NATIVE_BENCHMARK` gate exits 0 with `SKIPPED_WITH_CAVEAT` and no native renderer imports. |
| `npm run static-routes:check` | PASS_WITH_CAVEATS | Route rows 11, policy failures 0, native route ownership PASS, absent `out` caveat, hosted probes skipped with caveat. |
| `npm run static-output:check` | PASS_WITH_CAVEATS | Header, redirect, config, route policy, and native artifact checks pass; `out` and native artifact inspection report accepted caveats. |
| `npm run validate:deployment` | PASS_WITH_CAVEATS | Deployment parity source check, app-store diff, native-rendering check, static-output check, and closed Docker smoke path passed. |
| `npm run docker:smoke` | PASS_WITH_CAVEAT | Closed `PHASE9_RUN_DOCKER_SMOKE` gate exits 0 with `SKIPPED_WITH_CAVEAT`. |
| Open benchmark wrapper | PASS | Wrapper observed nonzero `npm run native-rendering:benchmark` output containing `BLOCKED` when `PHASE12_RUN_NATIVE_BENCHMARK=1`. |
| Open Docker wrapper | PASS | Wrapper observed nonzero `npm run docker:smoke` output containing `BLOCKED` when `PHASE9_RUN_DOCKER_SMOKE=1`. |

## Resolved Research Defaults

| Decision Area | Phase 12 Default | Validation Impact |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Static artifact directory | Deterministic source artifacts live under `public/generated/native-images`; static export copies them to `out/generated/native-images`. | Policy and static-output guards validate source paths immediately and exported paths when `out` exists. |
| Runtime cache header | Runtime routes and unversioned compatibility URLs use `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`. | Route helper and policy checks preserve current cache behavior. |
| Versioned static artifact cache | Longer immutable caching is reserved for fully versioned static artifact URLs declared in `config/native-rendering-policy.json`. | Guard checks distinguish runtime compatibility URLs from fully versioned static artifact URLs. |
| PNG benchmark path | PNG `ImageResponse` smoke runs only inside the Node 20/native/Next runtime open gate. Default/source tests use Satori SVG fixtures and injected renderers. | Current-shell open-gate verifies use wrappers that pass only when `BLOCKED` is observed. |
