# Sealos.io Performance Audit

This report is the durable v1 performance audit ledger. Later phases append
evidence, findings, validation results, and remediation ordering here so shared
mechanisms are grouped once.

## Finding Schema

Every later finding must use this contract. The fields are intentionally stable
so module-level evidence can be counted, deduplicated, dismissed, or promoted
without rewriting earlier audit work.

| Field | Allowed Values or Format | Required | Notes |
|-------|--------------------------|----------|-------|
| status | `candidate`, `confirmed`, `dismissed`, `deferred` | yes | Lifecycle value for counting and remediation planning. |
| severity | `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` | yes | Use `info` for inventory-only notes. |
| phase | `1` through `7` | yes | Phase that owns the evidence or dismissal. |
| files | Backtick paths, comma-separated | yes | Include file-level evidence paths. |
| entry point | Route, script, component, asset group, workflow, or config file | yes | Name the trigger or user/developer path. |
| module boundary | Must match a row in [Module Inventory](#module-inventory) | yes | Keeps findings attached to a stable owner. |
| work type | CPU, network, filesystem I/O, native rendering, bundle, hydration, asset, developer workflow | yes | Cost category. Keep separate from execution timing. |
| execution timing | build, static generation, request, page entry, interaction, CI, Docker, deployment | yes | When the work happens. Keep separate from work type. |
| evidence | File path plus concrete source, command, or measurement reason | yes | Every finding needs evidence and a performance reason. |
| root cause | Short text | yes for `candidate`, `confirmed`, and `deferred` | Reuse the shared mechanism when duplicate key is reused. |
| impact | User-facing, build-time, developer workflow, or deployment variance impact | yes for `candidate`, `confirmed`, and `deferred` | Describe why the cost matters. |
| remediation direction | Short direction, not a full implementation plan during v1 | yes for `candidate`, `confirmed`, and `deferred` | Keep fixes in later fix phases. |
| validation coverage | `tested`, `source-text only`, `typecheck only`, `manual only`, `unvalidated` | yes | Update when stronger evidence is collected. |
| duplicate key | Kebab-case key from the registry or a route/module-local key | yes | Reuse when root cause and remediation path are shared. |
| dismissal rationale | Text or `n/a` | yes | Required for `dismissed`; use `n/a` for active findings. |

### Finding Row Template

| ID | status | severity | phase | files | entry point | module boundary | work type | execution timing | evidence | root cause | impact | remediation direction | validation coverage | duplicate key | dismissal rationale |
|----|--------|----------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|----------|------------|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| EXAMPLE-000 | candidate | info | 1 | `path/to/file.ts` | `route-or-script` | Inventory boundary | CPU | request | Evidence path and reason. | Shared mechanism. | Impact category. | Direction only. | source-text only | `example-key` | n/a |

## Module Inventory

Inventory rows are broad by design. Later phases can add child rows or detailed
findings while keeping the same module boundary vocabulary.

## Duplicate-Key Policy

Duplicate keys group repeated symptoms under the same root cause and remediation
path. Reuse a key when the mechanism is shared across files, routes, or
deployment targets. Create a route-local or module-local key when ownership,
root cause, and remediation direction are materially different.

| Duplicate Key | Shared Mechanism | Reuse Rule | Initial Evidence Pointers | Owner Phase |
|---------------|------------------|------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `app-store-data-pipeline` | App Store generated JSON, runtime API conversion, loader caches, filters, detail pages, template sources, and deploy flow. | Use when root cause is shared app-template normalization, cache scope, payload behavior, or repeated data transformation. | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `lib/api/apps-api.ts`, `config/apps-loader.ts`, `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/**` | Phase 3 |
| `app-detail-remote-readme` | App detail README candidate discovery, remote fetch sequence, markdown normalization, full markdown rendering, and README media resolution. | Use when the root cause is specific to README candidate fetch fan-out, markdown size/render cost, or remote README media behavior. | `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/ReadmeMarkdownWindow.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/ReadmePreview.tsx` | Phase 3 |
| `remote-template-build-step` | Remote template ingestion and generated artifact writes in the production build path. | Use when root cause is generator/build coupling, serial remote fetches, icon downloads, JSON churn, or build-time network sensitivity. | `package.json`, `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, `public/images/apps/**` | Phase 2 |
| `static-export-route-classification` | Static export deployment with API-like routes and generated endpoints. | Use when root cause is a mismatch or ambiguity between static artifact, runtime route handler, external-service-backed endpoint, and deployment-specific path. | `next.config.mjs`, `app/api/**/route.ts`, `app/rss.xml/route.ts`, `app/sitemap-index.xml/route.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/sitemap-ai-faq.ts`, `app/llms.txt/route.ts`, `vercel.json`, `public/_redirects` | Phase 4 |
| `fumadocs-search-index` | Fumadocs loaders and localized content feeding search payloads, docs pages, and content discovery. | Use when root cause is search generation, payload growth, metadata-only relevance limits, content traversal, or language sharding. | `app/api/search/route.ts`, `components/docs/Search.tsx`, `lib/source.ts`, `source.config.ts`, `content/docs/**` | Phase 4 |
| `og-native-rendering` | Canvas, Sharp, font, and generated thumbnail image rendering paths. | Use when root cause is native rendering CPU, memory, cache keys, build/runtime variance, or static pre-generation opportunity. | `app/api/og/route.ts`, `lib/og-canvas.ts`, `app/api/blog/[lang]/[slug]/thumbnail/[format]/**`, `fonts/**`, `Dockerfile`, `package.json` | Phase 5 |
| `shared-auth-interaction-check` | Shared auth verification, auth modal email request/verification, and deploy/auth handoff checks. | Use when root cause is interaction-time network work before navigation, modal state, or deploy continuation. | `hooks/use-auth-redirect.ts`, `lib/utils/shared-auth.ts`, `new-components/AuthForm/**`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `config/site.ts` | Phase 5 |
| `turnstile-request-verification` | Abuse form Turnstile submission, process-local rate limiting, and Cloudflare siteverify request behavior. | Use when root cause is request-time external Turnstile verification, rate-limit map cleanup, or API route deployment variance. | `app/api/abuse/verify-turnstile/route.ts`, `app/[lang]/abuse/components/abuse-form.tsx`, `config/site.ts` | Phase 5 |
| `shared-layout-bundle-cost` | Locale layout providers, analytics, docs search, auth modal, deploy modal, header/footer, and route-wide client boundaries. | Use when root cause is shared shell bundle reach, hydration cost, globally mounted client surfaces, or third-party script baseline. | `app/[lang]/layout.tsx`, `components/analytics/**`, `components/docs/Search.tsx`, `new-components/AuthForm/**`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `new-components/Header.tsx` | Phase 6 |
| `visual-animation-loop-cost` | Route-local visual effects using Motion, Framer Motion, canvas loops, Matter.js physics, timers, and media modals. | Use when root cause is animation scheduling, physics, canvas drawing, iframe/video activation, or route-local visual hydration above the shared shell baseline. | `app/[lang]/(home)/(new-home)/**`, `new-components/GodRays.tsx`, `components/video.tsx` | Phase 6 |
| `static-export-asset-delivery` | Static-export image and asset delivery where browser transfer depends on source assets, unoptimized images, SVG policy, remote patterns, and host cache behavior. | Use when root cause is general cross-route static export asset delivery or image policy rather than App Store generated media shape. | `next.config.mjs`, `public/**`, `assets/**`, `fonts/**` | Phase 6 |
| `customer-interaction-scheduling` | Customer page filter, testimonial, table-of-contents, markdown, scroll, resize, timer, and rAF scheduling. | Use when root cause is customer-route interaction scheduling and markdown/filter work above the shared shell baseline. | `app/[lang]/customers/**` | Phase 6 |
| `deployment-command-parity` | Build, install, environment, static export, serving, redirects, headers, cache, route support, and native dependency behavior differ across Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Docker/Nginx, GHCR, and Kubernetes paths. | Use when root cause is deployment-target command/config parity across CI, static export hosts, image build, and runtime serving. | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `.github/workflows/preview.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml`, `.github/workflows/preview-cloudflare.yml`, `.github/workflows/build-image.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `vercel.json`, `public/_headers`, `public/_redirects`, `next.config.mjs`, `package.json` | Phase 7 |
| `next-package-version-alignment` | Next runtime, `@next/*` tooling, MDX integration, analyzer behavior, and lockfile exact versions are aligned through package and lockfile evidence rather than semver ranges alone. | Use when root cause is version alignment evidence for Next, `@next/bundle-analyzer`, `@next/mdx`, MDX/Fumadocs packages, static export config, analyzer reliability, or build/deployment variance. | `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.nvmrc`, `next.config.mjs` | Phase 7 |

## Seed Candidate Notes

These are seed audit notes from `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` and
`.planning/research/*`. They are not detailed findings yet. Later phases should
promote, merge, dismiss, or replace them with measured evidence.

| Seed ID | Status | Duplicate Key | Module Boundary | Evidence Paths | Work Type | Execution Timing | Candidate Reason | Validation Coverage | Later Owner |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| SEED-01 | candidate | `remote-template-build-step` | `scripts`, `package.json`, `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, `public/images/apps` | `package.json`, `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, `public/images/apps/**` | network, filesystem I/O, developer workflow | build, CI, Docker | `npm run build` includes app generation; the generator fetches remote templates, downloads icons, fetches template sources, and writes generated artifacts. | source-text only | Phase 2 |
| SEED-02 | candidate | `app-store-data-pipeline` | `config`, `lib`, `app/[lang]`, `components` | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `lib/api/apps-api.ts`, `config/apps-loader.ts`, `config/apps.ts`, `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx` | CPU, network, hydration | static generation, request, interaction | Static generator, runtime API conversion, loader fallback, and UI filtering share App Store concepts that need one data-subsystem audit. | source-text only | Phase 3 |
| SEED-03 | candidate | `fumadocs-search-index` | `app/api`, `lib`, `content`, `components` | `app/api/search/route.ts`, `lib/source.ts`, `content/docs/**`, `components/docs/Search.tsx` | CPU, filesystem I/O, bundle | static generation, request, page entry | Search currently indexes metadata and headings; full-body search would increase payload and build/runtime work. | source-text only | Phase 4 |
| SEED-04 | candidate | `og-native-rendering` | `app/api`, `lib`, `fonts`, `Dockerfile` | `app/api/og/route.ts`, `lib/og-canvas.ts`, `fonts/**`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile` | CPU, native rendering, asset | request, Docker, deployment | OG generation uses native image tooling and should be audited for CPU cost, cache behavior, and deployment variance. | source-text only | Phase 5 |
| SEED-05 | candidate | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` | `app/[lang]`, `components`, `new-components`, `hooks` | `app/[lang]/layout.tsx`, `components/analytics/**`, `components/docs/Search.tsx`, `new-components/AuthForm/**`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `new-components/Header.tsx`, `hooks/**` | bundle, hydration, network | page entry, interaction | The localized shell mounts global providers and client surfaces that every public route may pay for. | source-text only | Phase 6 |
| SEED-06 | candidate | `static-export-route-classification` | `app`, `next.config.mjs`, `vercel.json`, `.github/workflows` | `next.config.mjs`, `app/api/**/route.ts`, `app/rss.xml/route.ts`, `app/sitemap-index.xml/route.ts`, `app/llms.txt/route.ts`, `vercel.json`, `public/_redirects`, `.github/workflows/**` | developer workflow, CPU, deployment | static generation, request, deployment | Production static export and API-like route handlers require route classification by hosting target before severity is assigned. | source-text only | Phase 4 |

## Phase 1 Validation

Phase 1 validation proves the ledger exists, required schema fields are present,
required repository surfaces are represented, and duplicate keys are documented.
It uses local source checks only. Network-heavy, Docker, analyzer, route timing,
and browser trace commands belong to later phases.

### Validation Commands

## Phase 2: Build-Time App Catalog Pipeline

Phase 2 promotes the `remote-template-build-step` seed into source-grounded
build-time findings for APPPIPE-01 and APPPIPE-02. This phase covers the
generator, generated snapshots, build command coupling, and CI/Docker command
surfaces. Runtime App Store loader, API conversion, README rendering, filters,
detail pages, and deploy modal behavior remain Phase 3 `app-store-data-pipeline`
work.

### Phase 2 Source Audit

| Subpath | Files | Evidence | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|---------|-------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Template list fetch | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `fetchTemplates()` calls `https://template.os.sealos.io/api/listTemplate` with `fetch()` and validates the API response before returning templates. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:19-22` and `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:56-76`. | The build depends on an external network list before local app data can be refreshed. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| Serial template processing | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `processTemplates()` loops with `for (const template of templates)`, awaits `convertTemplateToAppConfig()`, then awaits `fetchTemplateSource()` per accepted app. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:467-556`. | Per-template conversion, icon handling, and source fetches are serialized, so total build time scales with accepted template count and remote latency. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| Icon download and shell call | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `convertTemplateToAppConfig()` awaits `downloadIcon()`, and `downloadIcon()` shells out with `execSync('curl ...')` using a 10000 ms timeout. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:199-203` and `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:366-403`. | Each non-default icon can add a blocking shell call, network transfer, filesystem write, and per-icon timeout ceiling. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| Template-source fetch | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `fetchTemplateSource()` calls `https://template.usw-1.sealos.io/api/getTemplateSource?templateName=...`; successful responses are reduced to input arrays through `extractTemplateSourceInputs()`. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:409-449` and `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:534-548`. | A second remote endpoint is queried per accepted app, adding serial build-time network work and generated-data variance. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| Clean mode image churn | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `--clean` triggers `cleanImagesDirectory()`, which removes and recreates `public/images/apps`. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:477-487` and `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:452-461`. | Clean generation can recreate the app image directory and create large generated asset diffs. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| Generated JSON writes | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json` | The generator sorts app configs and writes `config/apps.json` plus `config/template-sources.json` with `fs.writeFileSync()`. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:558-576`. | Each refresh can rewrite generated snapshots, which affects build artifacts, review diffs, and downstream App Store data truth. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| List-fetch network failure | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | Recognized network failures in `fetchTemplates()` are detected by `isNetworkError()` and cause `processTemplates()` to keep existing config by returning early. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:30-51` and `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:489-500`. | Network outages can silently retain prior generated snapshots, making build success distinct from data freshness. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| Per-template source failure | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `config/template-sources.json` | `fetchTemplateSource()` returns `null` on error; the caller writes an empty input array for that app and increments `sourceFailedCount`. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:429-435` and `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:545-548`. | Partial source failures preserve the build path while degrading generated template input completeness. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |

### Build Coupling And Timing Categories

| Category | Command Surface | Files | Evidence | Phase 2 Classification | Validation Coverage |
|----------|-----------------|-------|----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `npm run generate-apps` | Local generator refresh | `package.json`, `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `package.json:12` maps `generate-apps` to `node scripts/generate-apps-api.js`. | Remote template list fetch, serial per-app source fetches, icon downloads, generated JSON writes, and app image writes. | source-text only |
| `next build` | Local production build | `package.json` | `package.json:7` runs `npm run generate-apps && next build && node scripts/normalize-root-locale.js`. | Aggregate build category containing generator, Next static export, and export normalization. | source-text only |
| `npm run build:analyze` | Analyzer build | `package.json` | `package.json:8` runs `npm run generate-apps && ANALYZE=true next build && node scripts/normalize-root-locale.js`. | Analyzer timing includes the same remote generator pre-step; bundle interpretation belongs to Phase 6. | source-text only |
| Export normalization | Static export post-processing | `scripts/normalize-root-locale.js` | The script copies entries from `out/en` to `out` with `fs.cp()` after checking output directories. See `scripts/normalize-root-locale.js:23-50`. | Filesystem I/O after Next export, separate from generator and Next build work. | source-text only |
| Docker build | Docker builder | `Dockerfile` | The builder installs native/system dependencies, runs image path replacement, then runs `npm ci && npm run build`. See `Dockerfile:1-35`. | Docker timing includes package install, image path replacement, generator, Next build, and normalization. | source-text only |
| CI build | Cloudflare and Vercel workflows | `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml`, `.github/workflows/preview-cloudflare.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `.github/workflows/preview.yml` | Cloudflare workflows run `npm ci` and `npm run build`; Vercel workflows install dependencies and run `vercel build`. See `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml:44-59`, `.github/workflows/preview-cloudflare.yml:184-192`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml:32-43`, and `.github/workflows/preview.yml:40-48`. | CI cost splits by hosting path; Cloudflare follows local static export build, while Vercel build behavior is hosted-tooling dependent. | source-text only |
| Deployment update | Docker image publish and Kubernetes image update | `.github/workflows/build-image.yml` | Docker image build uses `docker/build-push-action@v5`, then `kubectl` updates and annotates `deployment/sealos-docs`. See `.github/workflows/build-image.yml:56-89`. | Deployment update inherits Docker build artifact timing and adds downstream rollout steps. Full deployment parity belongs to Phase 7. | source-text only |

### Generated Snapshot Baseline

These counts are read-only local snapshot evidence collected on 2026-06-11.
They are a baseline for generated artifact churn and APPPIPE-02 category
separation. They are not remote refresh results.

| Artifact | Metric | Value | Command | Validation Coverage |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `config/apps.json` | Bytes | 203,676 | `wc -c config/apps.json config/template-sources.json` | source-text only |
| `config/template-sources.json` | Bytes | 71,833 | `wc -c config/apps.json config/template-sources.json` | source-text only |
| `config/apps.json` | App records | 150 | `node -e "const fs=require('fs'); console.log(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config/apps.json','utf8')).length)"` | source-text only |
| `config/template-sources.json` | Template-source keys | 150 | `node -e "const fs=require('fs'); console.log(Object.keys(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config/template-sources.json','utf8'))).length)"` | source-text only |
| `public/images/apps` | Files | 210 | `find public/images/apps -type f \| wc -l \| tr -d ' '` | source-text only |

### Phase 2 Findings

| ID | status | severity | phase | files | entry point | module boundary | work type | execution timing | evidence | root cause | impact | remediation direction | validation coverage | duplicate key | dismissal rationale |
|----|--------|----------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|----------|------------|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| PERF-201 | candidate | high | 2 | `package.json`, `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `scripts/normalize-root-locale.js` | `npm run build`, `npm run build:analyze` | `package.json`, `scripts` | network, filesystem I/O, developer workflow | build, CI, Docker | `package.json:7-13` wires `build` and `build:analyze` through `npm run generate-apps` before Next build/analyzer work; generator evidence is in `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:56-76`, `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:467-576`. | Production and analyzer builds are coupled to remote template ingestion and generated snapshot writes. | Build-time and CI latency can vary with remote API latency and generated data freshness; analyzer timing includes generator work. | Split remote catalog refresh from routine build/analyzer commands or make refresh an explicit guarded step with snapshot reuse for ordinary builds. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` | n/a |
| PERF-202 | candidate | high | 2 | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `node scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `scripts` | network, filesystem I/O, developer workflow | build, CI, Docker | `processTemplates()` uses a serial `for (const template of templates)` loop and awaits app conversion plus template-source fetch per accepted app. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:518-548`. | Per-template network and filesystem work is serialized. | Total generator time can grow linearly with template count, icon latency, and template-source endpoint latency. | Use bounded concurrency, caching, and per-stage timing around list fetch, icon downloads, source fetches, and JSON writes in a later fix phase. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` | n/a |
| PERF-203 | candidate | medium | 2 | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `public/images/apps` | `downloadIcon()` | `scripts`, `public/images/apps` | network, filesystem I/O, developer workflow | build, CI, Docker | `downloadIcon()` shells out to `curl` via `execSync()` with a 10000 ms timeout and writes downloaded files under `public/images/apps`. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:366-403`; current image snapshot has 210 files totaling 4,219,013 bytes. | Blocking per-icon shell downloads are part of catalog generation. | Slow or unreachable icon URLs can delay generation up to the per-icon timeout ceiling and create asset churn in the generated image directory. | Replace blocking shell downloads with a bounded async downloader, content-addressed or slug-stable cache checks, and diff-aware asset writes in a later fix phase. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` | n/a |
| PERF-204 | candidate | medium | 2 | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`, `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, `public/images/apps` | `npm run generate-apps`, `npm run generate-apps:clean` | `scripts`, `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, `public/images/apps` | filesystem I/O, developer workflow, asset | build, CI, Docker | The generator writes 203,676 bytes to `config/apps.json`, 71,833 bytes to `config/template-sources.json`, and clean mode removes/recreates `public/images/apps`. See `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:452-461` and `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:568-576`. | Generated app snapshots and app images are refreshed as build inputs. | Remote data changes can create review churn and deployment artifact differences beyond application source changes. | Add guarded refresh policy, generated diff review, stable sort/write behavior checks, and snapshot freshness metadata in later fix planning. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` | n/a |

### Skipped Optional Timing

| Measurement | Status | Reason | Guard For Future Manual Run | Validation Coverage |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| `time npm run generate-apps` | skipped | It can call remote template APIs, download icons, and rewrite `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, or `public/images/apps`. | Capture `git status --short`, then `git diff --stat -- config/apps.json config/template-sources.json public/images/apps` before and after the timing command. | manual only |
| `time npm run build` | skipped | It includes `npm run generate-apps`, `next build`, and root export normalization, so it can refresh generated artifacts before measuring Next work. | Use the generated-file guard above and record whether `out/` is created or modified. | manual only |
| `time npm run build:analyze` | skipped | It includes `npm run generate-apps` before analyzer output; bundle interpretation belongs to Phase 6. | Use the generated-file guard above and store analyzer output only as Phase 6 evidence. | manual only |
| `docker build .` | skipped | Docker is unavailable in this local shell, and the Dockerfile path includes package install plus `npm run build`. | Run in a Docker-capable environment with build cache state and generated-file diff notes. | unvalidated |
| `npm run generate-apps:clean` | skipped | Clean mode removes and recreates `public/images/apps`. | Use only behind an explicit generated-asset churn validation task. | manual only |

### Phase 8 Remediation Trace

Phase 8 converts `remote-template-build-step` from report-only evidence into
guarded build-pipeline controls. Ordinary `npm run build` and
`npm run build:analyze` now consume committed App Store snapshots. Remote
template work lives behind explicit App Store refresh commands, generated
snapshot review lives behind `npm run app-store:diff`, and stage timing lives
behind `scripts/measure-build-pipeline.js`.

| Finding | Phase 8 Evidence | Validation Coverage |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| PERF-201 | `package.json` separates `build` and `build:analyze` from `scripts/generate-apps-api.js`; explicit refresh remains available through `app-store:refresh` and compatibility `generate-apps` aliases. | `node --test scripts/generate-apps-api.test.mjs`; package script parser check |
| PERF-202 | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` adds `runLimited()` with default concurrency 6 for accepted template processing and template-source fetches. | `runLimited()` concurrency/order test; source failure shape test |
| PERF-203 | Icon handling uses async fetch with timeout, cache-hit reuse, temp-file rename, and failure accounting instead of shelling out to `curl`. | cache-hit test; icon failure fallback test |
| PERF-204 | Generated snapshot mutation is explicit refresh-only, and `scripts/check-generated-app-assets.js` validates `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, and `public/images/apps` before and after refresh/build/analyzer workflows. | `node --test scripts/check-generated-app-assets.test.mjs`; `npm run app-store:diff` |
| PERF-505 | The high-impact generator path is now split from ordinary builds, bounded for remote fan-out, and measurable as a separate refresh stage. | `node --test scripts/measure-build-pipeline.test.mjs`; gated live refresh timing |
| PERF-701 | Deployment parity remains a later phase boundary; Phase 8 gives deployment validation a snapshot-only build command and generated diff guard as prerequisites. | protected-scope diff check excludes deployment files |
| PERF-702 | Timing output records Node, npm, lockfile version, and locked package versions, with caveats when active Node major differs from `.nvmrc` or `node_modules` is absent. | gated Node 20 locked-dependency build/analyzer timing |

### Phase 9 Remediation Trace

Phase 9 converts `deployment-command-parity` from report-only evidence into a
maintained deployment checklist and deterministic guard foundation. The new
default validation path stays source/static-output based and keeps unsafe
network, deploy, Docker, browser, hosted-preview, external-service, and
generated-mutation checks behind explicit environment gates.

| Finding | Phase 9 Evidence | Validation Coverage |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| PERF-701 | `docs/deployment-parity.md` compares Vercel production, Vercel preview, Cloudflare Pages production, Cloudflare Pages preview, Docker/Nginx, and GHCR/Kubernetes across install, build, runtime, env, artifact, output, serving, redirect, header, cache, route-support, native, secret, and validation dimensions. `scripts/check-deployment-parity.js` validates checklist tokens, deployment source facts, package script wiring, and closed unsafe gate defaults. | `node --test scripts/check-deployment-parity.test.mjs`; `npm run deployment:check` |
| PERF-702 | `scripts/check-deployment-parity.js` exposes a locked-validation planner for `PHASE9_RUN_LOCKED_BUILD=1` that requires Node 20 from `.nvmrc`, installed `node_modules`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build:timed`, `npm run build:analyze:timed`, and generated diff guards around mutation-capable stages. | gated Node 20 locked-dependency build/analyzer validation; default local caveat when Node major or dependencies are unavailable |
| PERF-406 | `scripts/check-static-output.js` validates static-export prerequisites by parsing `next.config.mjs`, `vercel.json`, `public/_headers`, and `public/_redirects`, and by inspecting `out` artifacts when present. Route behavior and generated endpoint policy remain Phase 10 scope. | `node --test scripts/check-static-output.test.mjs`; `npm run static-output:check` |
| PERF-501 | `scripts/smoke-docker-nginx.js` adds an optional `PHASE9_RUN_DOCKER_SMOKE=1` disposable Docker/Nginx smoke path that verifies Dockerfile static-output copy assumptions before later native renderer policy work. Native rendering behavior remains Phase 12 scope. | `node --test scripts/smoke-docker-nginx.test.mjs`; gated Docker smoke |
| PERF-502 | Docker smoke prerequisites now cover the static serving boundary that thumbnail and OG native-rendering fixes must respect. Blog thumbnail pre-generation and renderer timing remain Phase 12 scope. | gated Docker smoke |
| PERF-605 | `scripts/check-static-output.js` compares immutable header/cache parity for `/mtc.js` and `/api/script.js` across Vercel and Cloudflare sources, while `scripts/smoke-docker-nginx.js` defines representative static asset probes for Docker/Nginx. Asset budgets and conversion work remain later owner scope. | `npm run static-output:check`; gated Docker smoke |

### Phase 12 Remediation Trace

Phase 12 converts `og-native-rendering` from report-only native image evidence
into a source-owned policy, shared renderer helper contract, local fixture
benchmark gate, static artifact alignment checks, and Docker/native guard
composition. Final fixed/validated/remaining audit status closeout remains
Phase 13 scope.

| Finding | Phase 12 Evidence | Validation Coverage |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| PERF-501 | `/api/og` now has policy rows for deterministic `public/generated/native-images` source artifacts, `out/generated/native-images` static export artifacts, cache-key dimensions, runtime `public, max-age=86400`, versioned immutable static artifact semantics, shared OG render helpers, and Dockerfile native dependency token checks. | `npm run native-rendering:check`; `npm run native-rendering:benchmark`; `npm run docker:smoke`; open-gate `BLOCKED` wrappers |
| PERF-502 | Blog thumbnail SVG/PNG surfaces now have policy rows for pre-generated formats, shared format/static-param/render helpers, exact font and background fixture byte contracts, fixture benchmark rows, static artifact status reporting, and route-policy ownership alignment. | `node --test scripts/check-native-rendering-policy.test.mjs scripts/benchmark-native-rendering.test.mjs`; `npm run static-routes:check`; `npm run static-output:check` |
| PERF-701 | Deployment validation now composes native rendering source checks with Phase 9 safe validation, and Docker smoke checks Node 20/native package assumptions plus `native-rendering:check` and the gated benchmark command when `PHASE9_RUN_DOCKER_SMOKE=1` is opened. | `npm run validate:deployment`; `node --test scripts/check-deployment-parity.test.mjs scripts/smoke-docker-nginx.test.mjs` |

NATIVE-01 is covered by the source-owned policy, cache-key helpers, and route
adapters. NATIVE-02 is covered by the local fixture benchmark gate and injected
renderer tests. NATIVE-03 is covered by Dockerfile native library token checks,
package/font policy validation, deployment guard composition, static artifact
status reporting, and fail-closed Docker/native wrappers.

### Phase 10 Remediation Trace

Phase 10 converts `static-export-route-classification` from route inventory
evidence into a source-owned policy and guard. `config/static-export-route-policy.json`
records route rows, classification labels, supported deployment behavior, budget
owners, validation commands, and ROUTEFIX/PERF trace IDs. `docs/static-export-route-policy.md`
mirrors the same policy for human review. `scripts/check-static-export-routes.js`
validates policy drift, source files, artifact path containment, generated
artifact budgets, documented robots behavior, and hosted probe gating. Phase 9
deployment validation now reaches Phase 10 through `npm run static-output:check`
and also requires the standalone `static-routes:check` package script.

| Finding | Phase 10 Evidence | Validation Coverage |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| PERF-401 | `/api/search` is classified as `static artifact via route handler` with `search-index` ownership and a 3000-record / 3145728-byte budget, preserving `fumadocs-search-index` traceability. | `node --test scripts/check-static-export-routes.test.mjs`; `npm run static-routes:check` |
| PERF-402 | `/llms.txt` is classified as `static artifact via route handler` with `llms` ownership and a 500-source-doc / 2097152-byte budget over the generated text artifact. | `node --test scripts/check-static-export-routes.test.mjs`; `npm run static-output:check` |
| PERF-404 | Main sitemap and AI FAQ sitemap rows are first-class static artifacts with 5000-URL / 2097152-byte budgets per artifact. | `npm run static-routes:check` |
| PERF-406 | Route policy covers sitemap, AI FAQ sitemap, RSS, sitemap index, `llms.txt`, search, robots, `/api/apps`, OG, blog thumbnails, and Turnstile verification with explicit labels for static, deployment-supported, API-like fallback, runtime native, and external-service-backed behavior. | `node --test scripts/check-static-export-routes.test.mjs scripts/check-static-output.test.mjs scripts/check-deployment-parity.test.mjs` |
| PERF-503 | `llms.txt` direct docs traversal now has an enforceable static output budget and remains traced to `static-export-route-classification`. | `npm run static-routes:check` |

ROUTEFIX-01 is covered by the route policy map. ROUTEFIX-02 is covered by
static artifact or documented deployment-supported behavior for generated
SEO/search/text outputs. ROUTEFIX-03 is covered by sitemap, search, and
`llms.txt` byte/count budgets. ROUTEFIX-04 is covered by Phase 9 composition,
missing-`out` caveat semantics, and the gated hosted probe contract.

Deployment target comparison, Docker smoke policy, Node locked-build
orchestration, shared shell bundle/hydration, native OG/blog thumbnail rendering
policy, analytics/auth/deploy loading, and browser trace closeout remain with
their owner phases.

## Phase 2 Validation

Phase 2 validation uses source scans, local snapshot counts, report token checks,
and the existing offline generator conversion test. Remote refresh, build,
analyzer, Docker, and clean-mode timing are recorded as skipped optional
evidence above.

## Phase 3: App Store Runtime and Static Data Path

Phase 3 promotes the `app-store-data-pipeline` seed into a user-facing App
Store subsystem audit for APPPIPE-03, APPPIPE-04, and APPPIPE-05. This phase
covers committed static snapshots, runtime API conversion, loader caches,
fallback behavior, index/detail pages, filtering and sorting, README fetch and
markdown render behavior, screenshots, icons, template-source lookup, and deploy
modal flow. It also adds the route-local `app-detail-remote-readme` key for
README-specific fetch/render findings.

### Phase 3 Source Audit

| Subpath | Files | Evidence | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|---------|-------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Static catalog snapshot | `config/apps.json`, `config/apps.ts` | The committed snapshot has 150 app records and `appsConfig` maps that JSON into synchronous runtime data. `config/apps.ts` exposes `appsConfig`, lookup helpers, category helpers, and `getTemplateName()`. | The static payload is the source of truth for page rendering, sitemap entries, detail route params, SEO metadata, and deploy identity on the static path. | local counts, tested | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Template-source snapshot | `config/template-sources.json`, `hooks/use-template-source.ts` | The committed template-source snapshot has 150 keys and 297 input definitions; the hook imports it before considering a remote fallback. See `hooks/use-template-source.ts:5` and `hooks/use-template-source.ts:113-135`. | Deploy clicks depend on this client-loaded data before the modal can decide between a form, auth flow, redirect, or error state. | local counts, source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Loader caches and deploy URLs | `config/apps-loader.ts` | `categoryCache`, `allAppsCache`, `dynamicAppsCache`, `lastDynamicFetch`, and `DYNAMIC_CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000` are module-level state; `loadStaticApps()` adds `deployUrl` through `getDeployUrl(getTemplateName(app))`. See `config/apps-loader.ts:33-42`, `config/apps-loader.ts:115-122`, and `config/apps-loader.ts:136-150`. | The same app list can be reused as static, dynamic, category-filtered, or browser-session data with different freshness and fallback semantics. | source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Runtime `/api/apps` conversion | `lib/api/apps-api.ts`, `app/api/apps/[[...lang]]/route.ts` | The route delegates to `handleAppsRequest(lang)`, which fetches the remote template API, converts records, sorts by deploy count/name, and returns fallback static apps on error. See `lib/api/apps-api.ts:185-223`, `lib/api/apps-api.ts:231-276`, and `lib/api/apps-api.ts:283-315`. | Runtime conversion duplicates App Store normalization while emitting a different shape from the committed snapshot. | source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Static index page | `app/[lang]/products/app-store/page.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/components/app-store-content.tsx`, `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx` | The page imports `appsConfig`, passes it to page SEO, hero/showcase/grid composition, and the client grid. The grid computes category counts and visible rows with `useMemo()`. See `app/[lang]/products/app-store/page.tsx:14-90`, `app-store-content.tsx:4-31`, and `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx:200-239`. | Every App Store index visit pays for rendering the static app list, screenshot cards, category counts, filtering, sorting, and pagination state. | tested for grid source-text checks; source-text only for cost | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Browser filtering and sorting | `app/[lang]/products/app-store/components/app-store-browser-utils.ts`, `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx` | `getCategoryCounts()` and `getVisibleApps()` are called from the client grid; `getVisibleApps()` filters by query/category, sorts, clamps pagination, and slices results. | The work is repeated per query/category/sort/page change and scales with the full app list currently counted at 150 records. | source-text only; utility test gap recorded | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Detail page and related data | `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/app-detail-utils.ts` | `generateStaticParams()` expands canonical and legacy slugs from `loadAllApps()`, the page uses `getAppBySlug()`, `appsConfig`, `getRelatedApps()`, and `loadReadmeMarkdown(app)`. See `page.tsx:50-60` and `page.tsx:86-100`. | Static params, metadata, related templates, README fetches, and detail render work all depend on the same static app record shape. | tested for detail source-text checks; source-text only for cost | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| README candidate fetch and render | `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/ReadmeMarkdownWindow.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/ReadmePreview.tsx` | `fetchReadme()` iterates candidate URLs with `cache: 'force-cache'`, reads the full response text, normalizes markdown, and `ReactMarkdown` renders the whole string with `remark-gfm`. See `ReadmeMarkdownWindow.tsx:289-310` and `ReadmeMarkdownWindow.tsx:397-508`. | Detail pages can pay remote candidate fetch latency and full markdown render cost before the README preview is available. | source-text only | `app-detail-remote-readme` |
| Screenshots, icons, and media | `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/AppPreviewPanel.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/Screenshots.tsx`, `components/ui/app-icon.tsx`, `next.config.mjs` | App cards and detail panels use first screenshots through `next/image`; the snapshot has 150 remote screenshot URLs and 150 local icon paths; `next.config.mjs` sets `images.unoptimized: true`. See `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx:92-115` and `next.config.mjs:54-97`. | Static export leaves remote screenshots and local icons as browser-delivered media, so page-entry transfer and image scheduling depend on data shape and component usage. | local counts, source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Deploy modal flow | `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx`, `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/DeployButton.tsx`, `new-components/DeployModal/DeployModalContext.tsx`, `new-components/DeployModal/DeployModalInner.tsx`, `new-components/DeployModal/TemplateForm.tsx` | Grid/detail deploy actions call `openDeployModal(getTemplateName(app))`; the provider awaits `fetchTemplateSource(templateName)` before opening form/error state or checking auth for no-input templates. See `components/app-store/app-grid.tsx:333-335` and `DeployModalContext.tsx:62-132`. | Deploy click latency includes template-source lookup, form-data initialization, auth check, and redirect construction. | source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` |

### Static And Runtime Shape Comparison

| Field | Static Snapshot | Runtime Conversion | Audit Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `slug` | 150 records include canonical static `slug` values. | Runtime converter emits `slug: metadata.name`. | Runtime can expose upstream naming directly while static data uses the generated canonical value. |
| `templateName` | 3 records include `templateName`. | Runtime converter source scan reports `templateName: false`. | Mixed-case template deploy identity is preserved only by the static snapshot path. |
| `legacySlugs` | 3 records include non-empty `legacySlugs`. | Runtime converter source scan reports `legacySlugs: false`. | Legacy detail route support is tied to static data and `matchesAppSlug()`. |
| `description` | 150 records include descriptions. | Runtime converter emits `description: spec.description`. | Static and runtime paths can carry different upstream normalization or fallback semantics. |
| `icon` | 150 records include local icon paths. | Runtime converter builds `icon` from `iconPath`. | Runtime icon paths assume generated asset availability without the static generator's exact snapshot context. |
| `screenshots` | 150 records include screenshots; 150 screenshot URLs are remote. | Runtime converter emits `Array.isArray(spec.screenshots) ? spec.screenshots : []`. | Static fallback media completeness can differ from upstream runtime availability. |
| `readme` | 150 records include README URLs; all are raw GitHub URLs. | Runtime converter emits `readme: spec.readme`. | README render cost is data-dependent and remote. |
| `github` | 149 records include GitHub URLs. | Runtime converter emits `github: spec.gitRepo`. | GitHub fallback candidate discovery depends on runtime/static source completeness. |
| `website` | 150 records include website URLs. | Runtime converter emits `website: spec.url`. | Website values can participate in README source discovery when GitHub-like. |
| `tags` | 150 records include tags. | Runtime converter emits `tags: spec.categories`. | Tags feed search/filter strings in client interactions. |
| `source` | 150 records include source objects. | Runtime converter emits `source.url` and `source.deployCount`. | Deploy-count sorting depends on source data in both paths. |
| `i18n` | 150 records include `i18n.zh.description`. | Runtime converter emits `i18n` only when upstream has locale data. | Localized copy can be more complete in static snapshot rendering than dynamic runtime rendering. |
| `deployUrl` | Raw static JSON records have no `deployUrl`; `config/apps-loader.ts` adds it during loading. | Runtime converter source scan reports `deployUrl: false`; browser dynamic loading adds it later in `fetchDynamicApps()`. | Deploy URLs are loader-derived fields, so raw JSON/API payload consumers see different shapes before loader normalization. |

### Cache And Fallback Matrix

| Path | Cache / Fallback Evidence | Audit Interpretation | Validation Coverage |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Static imports | `config/apps.ts` imports `config/apps.json` and exports `appsConfig`; App Store index content passes that value to hero, showcase, and grid. | Static pages use committed generated data as their current truth. | source-text only |
| Module-level loader caches | `config/apps-loader.ts` keeps `categoryCache`, `allAppsCache`, `dynamicAppsCache`, `lastDynamicFetch`, and a 5-minute `DYNAMIC_CACHE_TTL`. | Server/static and browser paths can reuse process/session-local values with separate freshness behavior. | source-text only |
| Browser dynamic cache | `USE_DYNAMIC_LOADING = typeof window !== 'undefined'`; browser `loadAllApps()` can fetch `/api/apps`, cache it, and fall back to static apps on failure. | Any client caller of `loadAllApps()` can mix dynamic freshness with static fallback data. | source-text only |
| `/api/apps` fallback | `handleAppsRequest()` catches remote API failures and returns `loadFallbackApps()`; `loadFallbackApps()` returns `[]` if the static import also fails. | Runtime API consumers can receive HTTP 200 with static fallback data or an empty list. | source-text only |
| README fetch cache | README candidates are fetched with `cache: 'force-cache'`. | Detail page README latency can be cached by the platform, while candidate fan-out and full response parsing remain source-level risks. | source-text only |
| Deploy modal hook state | `useTemplateSource()` stores one `data` value, `isLoading`, and `error`; `openDeployModal()` awaits fetch/lookup before opening form or error state. | Deploy click latency is user-visible when template-source data misses the local JSON or returns slowly. | source-text only |

### Phase 3 Findings

Detail pages derive related apps from the full static list. | Repeated derived-data transformations are distributed across App Store UI and detail helpers. | Interaction cost grows with payload size and repeated state changes; current utility test command reports 0 tests, so behavior coverage is incomplete in this shell. | Centralize and memoize derived App Store indexes where useful, and repair the utility test command before marking filter/sort behavior tested. | source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` | n/a |

### Phase 3 Skipped Validation

| Measurement | Status | Reason | Future Guard | Validation Coverage |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| remote README smoke | skipped | Phase 3 excludes remote README fetch loops; source evidence already shows candidate fetch and render behavior. | Use a single-app smoke with explicit network notes if later severity needs live latency evidence. | manual only |
| generated data refresh | skipped | `npm run generate-apps` can contact remote APIs and rewrite `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, and `public/images/apps`. | Run only in a generated-data refresh task with before/after git diff guards. | manual only |
| `npm run generate-apps` | skipped | It belongs to Phase 2 generator/build work and can mutate generated artifacts. | Keep as explicit refresh validation, separated from runtime App Store audit. | manual only |
| `npm run build` | skipped | The script runs `npm run generate-apps` before Next build. | Use generated-file guards and separate generator timing from Next build timing. | manual only |
| `npm run build:analyze` | skipped | The analyzer command runs the generator first, and bundle interpretation belongs to Phase 6. | Capture analyzer output in Phase 6 with generated-file guards. | manual only |
| Broad `/api/apps` or template-source polling | skipped | Phase 3 excludes production load tests and high-volume endpoint polling. | Use controlled request counts and target environment approval in a later measurement phase. | unvalidated |
| Production endpoint stress tests | skipped | Live traffic and operational load testing are out of scope for v1 source audit. | Require separate operational approval and traffic controls. | unvalidated |

### Phase 3 Validation

Phase 3 validation used local/source-text commands only. Application source,
generated JSON, app images, package files, and configuration source remained
read-only.

## Phase 4: Route Classification and Content/Generated Endpoints

Phase 4 extends the audit ledger with route execution classification,
Fumadocs/content traversal, generated endpoint behavior, and static export
context for ROUTE-01, ROUTE-02, CONTENT-01, CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03, and
CONTENT-04. This pass is audit-only: application source, content, generated
snapshots, deployment files, and package files were read-only evidence.

### Phase 4 Route Inventory And Classification

Local source inventory on 2026-06-11 found 47 route-like files under `app`: 22
`page.tsx`, 8 `layout.tsx`, 2 `loading.tsx`, 2 `not-found.tsx`, 2 `error.tsx`,
9 `route.ts`, and 2 `sitemap.ts`. 35 route-like entries are localized under
`app/[lang]`, and 6 API route handlers live under `app/api`.

Exact route category labels for this phase are: `static page`,
`generated static artifact`, `runtime route handler`,
`external-service-backed endpoint`, and `deployment-specific path`.

### Phase 4 Content Corpus Baseline

| Corpus | File Count | Content File Count | Byte Baseline | Validation Coverage | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| `content/docs` | 662 | 305 `*.mdx`/`*.md` | `*.en.mdx` 416,030 bytes; `*.zh-cn.mdx` 579,520 bytes | local counts | `llms.txt`, docs pages, docs sitemap entries, metadata, and search all depend on this corpus. |
| `content/blog` | 329 | 166 `*.mdx`/`*.md` | 3,687,149 bytes | local counts | Blog pages, RSS, blog article layout/schema, and main sitemap depend on this corpus. |
| `content/ai-quick-reference` | 2000 | 2000 JSON files | 3,755,109 bytes | local counts | FAQ detail params and AI FAQ sitemap expand from this corpus. |
| `config/apps.json` | 1 | 150 app records | Phase 3 baseline: 203,676 bytes | local counts | Phase 4 cites this only as input to `app/sitemap.ts`; App Store ownership remains Phase 3. |

### Fumadocs Loader Traversal Map

| Loader | Definition Boundary | Observed Traversal | Route/Helper Consumers | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `source` | `source.config.ts` defines docs at `content/docs`; `lib/source.ts` exposes `source = loader({ baseUrl: '/docs', source: createMDXSource(docs, meta) })`. | `source.getLanguages()`, `source.getPages()`, `source.getPage()`, `source.generateParams()`, `source.pageTree`. | `/api/search`, `app/sitemap.ts`, docs layout, docs page, `generateDocsMetadata`. | Docs content is traversed for static params, page render, metadata, sitemap, search index, and shared docs chrome. | source-text only, local counts | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| `blog` | `source.config.ts` defines blog at `content/blog`; `lib/source.ts` exposes `blog = loader({ baseUrl: '/blog', source: createMDXSource(blogPosts, []) })`. | `blog.getPages()`, `blog.getPage()`, `blog.generateParams()`, `blog.pageTree`. | RSS, `app/sitemap.ts`, blog article page/layout, blog utilities, blog thumbnail route, `generateBlogMetadata`. | Blog content is traversed for feed, sitemap, article render, metadata, related articles, adjacent posts, FAQ/HowTo schema, and future image generation. | source-text only, local counts | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| `faqSource` | `source.config.ts` defines AI quick reference meta collection at `content/ai-quick-reference`; `lib/source.ts` exposes `faqSource = loader({ baseUrl: '/ai-quick-reference', source: createMDXSource(aiQuickReference, []) })`. | `faqSource.getPages()`, `faqSource.getLanguages()`. | AI FAQ sitemap, AI quick reference detail static params, FAQ utilities. | 2000 JSON records can expand static params, sitemap entries, and helper traversal cost. | source-text only, local counts | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| Direct filesystem scans | Outside loader boundary in `app/llms.txt/route.ts` and `lib/utils/blog-utils.ts`. | `fast-glob`, async `fs.readFile`, `gray-matter`, `remark` pipeline; blog category helpers read `content/blog`. | `/llms.txt`, blog category utilities. | Direct scans duplicate content traversal outside the canonical Fumadocs loader and make payload budgeting harder. | source-text only | `static-export-route-classification` |

### Localized Rendering Path Map

| Path | Files | Rendering/Traversal Evidence | Phase 4 Interpretation | Validation Coverage |
|------|-------|------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Docs page | `app/[lang]/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`, `app/[lang]/docs/layout.tsx` | `source.getPage()`, `source.generateParams()`, `source.pageTree`, `generateDocsMetadata`, MDX body, `ImageZoom`, `Mermaid`, `PageActions`, AI share controls. | Docs pages have repeated loader and metadata traversal plus route-render widgets; bundle/hydration ownership for widgets remains Phase 6. | source-text only |
| Blog article | `app/[lang]/(home)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/[lang]/(home)/blog/[slug]/layout.tsx` | `blog.getPage()`, `blog.generateParams()`, `blog.getPages()`, `blog.pageTree`, `generateBlogMetadata`, article schema, FAQ schema through `Promise.all()`, HowTo schema, related articles, `ImageZoom`, `Mermaid`, FAQ accordions, `ReactMarkdown`, AI share controls. | Blog articles duplicate loader work across page, layout, metadata, related article selection, and schema generation. | source-text only |
| Blog listing/category | `app/[lang]/(home)/blog/page.tsx`, `category/page.tsx`, `category/[category]/page.tsx`, `lib/utils/blog-utils.ts` | Blog utilities call `blog.getPages(lang)`, category helpers, related filtering, and client tag/category controls. | Listing and category paths scale with the blog corpus and share traversal root cause with article routes. | source-text only |
| AI quick reference | `app/[lang]/(home)/ai-quick-reference/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/[lang]/(home)/ai-quick-reference/sitemap.ts`, `app/sitemap-ai-faq.ts` | Detail params use English `faqSource.getPages('en')` and generate params for `en` and `zh-cn`; sitemap reads `faqSource.getPages()` by language. | 2000 JSON files create a static-param and sitemap growth surface. | source-text only, local counts |
| Search client | `components/docs/Search.tsx`, `app/[lang]/layout.tsx` | `DefaultSearchDialog` uses `useDocsSearch`, static Orama search, Mandarin tokenizer, and language tag filtering through shared locale shell. | Client search behavior shares the `fumadocs-search-index` root cause with `/api/search`. | source-text only |

### Generated Endpoint Table

| Endpoint / Helper | Files | Category | Source Evidence | Payload/Cache Behavior | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|-------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `/api/search` | `app/api/search/route.ts`, `components/docs/Search.tsx`, `lib/source.ts` | generated static artifact | `createSearchAPI('advanced')`, `source.getLanguages().flatMap(...)`, heading-oriented structured data, metadata-oriented `content`, Mandarin tokenizer, `staticGET: GET`. | `revalidate = false`; search index includes page headings and excludes full-body docs content. | source-text only | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| `/rss.xml` | `app/rss.xml/route.ts`, `lib/source.ts` | generated static artifact | `blog.getPages(defaultLanguage)`, `new Feed(...)`, `feed.rss2()`, `NextResponse`. | `revalidate = false`; cache headers set in response; feed size scales with default-language blog pages. | source-text only | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| `/sitemap-index.xml` | `app/sitemap-index.xml/route.ts` | generated static artifact | Emits XML with main sitemap and AI FAQ sitemap locations through `NextResponse`. | `revalidate = false`; small generated XML route. | source-text only | `static-export-route-classification` |
| Main sitemap | `app/sitemap.ts`, `lib/source.ts`, `config/apps.json` | generated static artifact | Combines `source.getPages()`, `blog.getPages()`, static product pages, App Store detail pages, comparison combinations, and locale-specific marketing pages. | `revalidate = false`; app records counted at 150; docs/blog counts from local corpus. | source-text only, local counts | `static-export-route-classification` |
| AI FAQ sitemap | `app/sitemap-ai-faq.ts` | generated static artifact | Reads `faqSource.getPages('en')` and `faqSource.getPages('zh-cn')`, escapes XML, returns MetadataRoute items. | `revalidate = false`, `dynamic = 'force-static'`; 2000 JSON records counted locally. | source-text only, local counts | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| `/llms.txt` | `app/llms.txt/route.ts` | generated static artifact | Uses `fast-glob`, async `fs.readFile`, `gray-matter`, `remarkMdx`, `remarkInclude`, `remarkGfm`, `remarkStringify`, and `Promise.all()`. | `revalidate = false`; scans either `*.en.mdx` or `*.zh-cn.mdx`; local byte baselines are 416,030 and 579,520 bytes before serialization overhead. | source-text only, local counts | `static-export-route-classification` |
| `/api/robots` | `app/api/robots/route.ts` | generated static artifact | Small text response selects host by default language and emits sitemap references. | No promoted finding; include for route classification. | source-text only | `static-export-route-classification` |
| Metadata helpers | `lib/utils/metadata.ts` | static page helper | `generateDocsMetadata` calls `source.getPage()`; `generateBlogMetadata` calls `blog.getPage()`. | Metadata generation duplicates page-loader traversal on docs/blog routes. | source-text only | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| Structured data helpers | `lib/utils/structured-data.ts`, `app/[lang]/(home)/blog/[slug]/layout.tsx` | static page helper | Article, breadcrumb, FAQ, and HowTo schema generation run in blog article layout. | FAQ schema maps answers through async plain-text conversion before JSON-LD render. | source-text only | `fumadocs-search-index` |

### Phase 4 Findings

| ID | status | severity | phase | files | entry point | module boundary | work type | execution timing | evidence | root cause | impact | remediation direction | validation coverage | duplicate key | dismissal rationale |

| PERF-402 | candidate | high | 4 | `app/llms.txt/route.ts`, `content/docs/**`, `source.config.ts` | `/llms.txt` | `app`, `content` | filesystem I/O, CPU | static generation, request, deployment | `app/llms.txt/route.ts:22-55` chooses localized docs globs, reads each file, parses frontmatter with `gray-matter`, processes markdown through `remark`, and joins the serialized output; local count commands found docs `*.en.mdx` at 416,030 bytes and `*.zh-cn.mdx` at 579,520 bytes before output metadata and markdown serialization. | `llms.txt` performs a direct docs filesystem scan and markdown pipeline outside the canonical Fumadocs loader. | Static export and hosting behavior can turn a large content scan into build-time or request-time CPU/filesystem cost, and output size grows with the docs corpus. | Precompute `llms.txt` as a static artifact or route it through the same content loader with payload-size budgets and language-specific output checks. | local counts, source-text only | `static-export-route-classification` | n/a |
| PERF-403 | candidate | medium | 4 | `app/[lang]/(home)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/[lang]/(home)/blog/[slug]/layout.tsx`, `lib/utils/metadata.ts`, `lib/utils/blog-utils.ts`, `lib/utils/structured-data.ts` | Blog article pages and metadata | `app/[lang]`, `lib`, `content` | CPU, filesystem I/O | static generation, page entry | Blog article page calls `blog.getPage()` and `blog.generateParams()`; article layout calls `blog.getPage()`, `blog.getPages()`, related article selection, FAQ schema plain-text conversion through `Promise.all()`, and structured data helpers; metadata helpers call `blog.getPage()` again. | Blog rendering, metadata, related articles, and schema generation repeat traversal over the blog loader/corpus. | Static generation cost can grow with 166 blog content files and 3,687,149 local bytes, with article pages paying repeated loader and schema work per route. | Consolidate blog page data derivation per route and memoize or precompute related/schema inputs where the loader output is reused. | local counts, source-text only | `fumadocs-search-index` | n/a |
| PERF-404 | candidate | medium | 4 | `app/sitemap.ts`, `lib/source.ts`, `config/apps.json`, `app/[lang]/(home)/comparison/config/platforms` | Main sitemap generation | `app`, `lib`, `config` | CPU | static generation, deployment | `app/sitemap.ts:39-97` aggregates docs pages, blog pages, static product pages, 150 App Store records from `config/apps.json`, comparison pair combinations from platform slugs, and locale-specific marketing paths into one MetadataRoute sitemap. | Main sitemap generation aggregates multiple route/content/product sources in one static artifact. | Sitemap size and generation CPU can grow across docs, blog, app records, and comparison combinations while deployment behavior is static-export dependent. | Add sitemap item count budgets and consider splitting large source families into separate static sitemap artifacts with shared cache policy. | local counts, source-text only | `static-export-route-classification` | n/a |
| PERF-405 | candidate | medium | 4 | `source.config.ts`, `lib/source.ts`, `app/[lang]/(home)/ai-quick-reference/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/sitemap-ai-faq.ts`, `content/ai-quick-reference/**` | AI quick reference pages and sitemap | `app/[lang]`, `app`, `lib`, `content` | CPU, filesystem I/O | static generation | `source.config.ts:70-79` defines a meta collection for AI quick reference; `lib/source.ts:28-32` exposes `faqSource`; detail params call `faqSource.getPages('en')` and expand both `en` and `zh-cn`; `app/sitemap-ai-faq.ts:21-43` reads English and Chinese FAQ pages. Local counts found 2000 JSON files totaling 3,755,109 bytes. | AI quick reference uses a large meta corpus for static params and sitemap generation. | Static generation and sitemap creation can scale with JSON corpus size, and language fallback behavior can multiply route params. | Add explicit FAQ corpus budgets, route-param counts, and sitemap split policy before increasing the AI quick reference dataset. | local counts, source-text only | `fumadocs-search-index` | n/a |
| PERF-406 | candidate | high | 4 | `next.config.mjs`, `app/api/search/route.ts`, `app/rss.xml/route.ts`, `app/sitemap-index.xml/route.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/sitemap-ai-faq.ts`, `app/llms.txt/route.ts`, `app/api/robots/route.ts`, `app/api/apps/[[...lang]]/route.ts`, `app/api/og/route.ts`, `app/api/blog/[lang]/[slug]/thumbnail/[format]/route.ts`, `app/api/abuse/verify-turnstile/route.ts` | Static export route-handler classification | `app`, `next.config.mjs`, `vercel.json`, `.github/workflows` | developer workflow, CPU, deployment | static generation, request, deployment | Route inventory found generated static artifacts, runtime route handlers, and external-service-backed endpoints in the same App Router tree; several generated endpoints use `revalidate = false`, `/api/search` uses `staticGET`, and `app/sitemap-ai-faq.ts` sets `dynamic = 'force-static'`. | Static export mixes generated artifacts, API-like routes, runtime handlers, and external-service-backed endpoints that need hosting-specific classification. | Build, request, CDN cache, and deployment behavior can differ across Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Docker/Nginx, and Kubernetes paths if route intent is implicit. | Create a deployment route matrix in Phase 7 and convert generated text/XML/search artifacts to explicit static outputs where static export should own them. | source-text only | `static-export-route-classification` | n/a |

### Phase 4 Skipped Validation

| Validation | Status | Reason | Validation Coverage |
|------------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| `npm run build` | skipped | Runs generated App Store refresh before Next build and can mutate generated artifacts. | manual only |
| `npm run build:analyze` | skipped | Runs generated App Store refresh and analyzer interpretation belongs to Phase 6. | manual only |
| Production endpoint polling | skipped | Phase 4 excludes production load, remote crawl, and endpoint stress validation. | unvalidated |
| Local dev server endpoint polling | skipped | Serving routes can hide static-export artifact behavior and is unnecessary for source classification. | manual only |
| Docker build | skipped | Deployment parity and Docker runtime behavior belong to Phase 7. | unvalidated |
| Browser trace | skipped | Shared shell, bundle, hydration, and interaction traces belong to Phase 6. | unvalidated |
| `/api/og` native rendering measurement | skipped | Native canvas/Sharp rendering ownership belongs to Phase 5; Phase 4 records classification only. | unvalidated |

## Phase 5: Function-Level Hotspots and Native Rendering

Phase 5 records helper-level performance root causes beneath the Phase 2, Phase
3, and Phase 4 route and subsystem findings. It covers HOTSPOT-01 through
HOTSPOT-04 with source-text scans, local font/background counts, duplicate-key
registry updates, and guarded skipped validation for runtime-heavy checks.

### Hotspot Inventory Summary

| Hotspot Class | Source Evidence | Owning Boundaries | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Synchronous filesystem | `lib/utils/blog-utils.ts` uses `fs.existsSync`, `fs.readdirSync`, and `fs.statSync`; `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` uses `fs.existsSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`, `fs.rmSync`, and `fs.writeFileSync`; `config/apps-data-quality.test.mts` and source-text tests read fixtures. | `lib`, `scripts`, `config` | Filesystem work is present on blog helper paths, generator paths, and validation support paths. Promoted findings focus on executable helpers and build/request surfaces. | source-text only | `fumadocs-search-index`, `remote-template-build-step` |
| Shell execution | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:16` imports `execSync`; `scripts/generate-apps-api.js:388` shells to `curl`; `scripts/url-index-audit.sh` contains multiple `curl` calls. | `scripts` | Build and audit scripts can block on shell/network calls; the generator path is part of production build coupling. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| CPU-heavy loops and nested transforms | `lib/og-canvas.ts` loops over triangle grid rows/columns and wrapped text words; `lib/utils/blog-utils.ts` filters, maps, sorts, and scores article groups; `app/sitemap.ts`, App Store helpers, and comparison helpers aggregate corpus-sized lists. | `lib`, `app`, `components`, `config` | CPU scales with render dimensions, content corpus size, app records, route params, and repeated derived-data transformations. | source-text only | `og-native-rendering`, `fumadocs-search-index`, `app-store-data-pipeline`, `static-export-route-classification` |
| Markdown/MDX processors | `app/llms.txt/route.ts` imports `fast-glob`, `gray-matter`, `remark`, `remarkMdx`, `remarkInclude`, `remarkGfm`, and `remarkStringify`; `lib/utils/content-utils.ts` uses `remark`, `remarkGfm`, and `remark-html`; `lib/remark/remark-mermaid.ts` walks the remark tree. | `app`, `lib`, `content` | Markdown processing can duplicate Fumadocs traversal and add CPU/filesystem cost to generated text, blog schema, and MDX build paths. | source-text only | `static-export-route-classification`, `fumadocs-search-index` |
| Native rendering | `app/api/og/route.ts` calls `drawCanvas()` and `sharp(...).webp().toBuffer()`; `lib/og-canvas.ts` registers fonts, creates canvas surfaces, loads images, and returns PNG buffers; blog thumbnails use `satori` and `ImageResponse`. | `app/api`, `lib`, `fonts`, `Dockerfile`, `package.json` | Canvas, Sharp, satori, ImageResponse, local fonts, and Docker native libraries can dominate request/static-generation cost and deployment variance. | local counts, source-text only | `og-native-rendering` |
| Network fan-out and concurrency | Generator fetches template list/source data, runtime apps API fetches remote templates, `use-template-source` has remote fallback, README candidates fetch with `cache: 'force-cache'`, shared auth/email flows fetch external endpoints, and Turnstile route posts to Cloudflare. | `scripts`, `lib`, `hooks`, `new-components`, `app/api`, `components` | User-facing interactions, request handlers, and builds can wait on external services or serial remote work. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step`, `app-store-data-pipeline`, `app-detail-remote-readme`, `shared-auth-interaction-check`, `turnstile-request-verification` |

### Native Rendering Table

| Surface | Files | Trigger Path | Native/Rendering Work | Cache / Key Evidence | Local Counts | Deployment Variance | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|---------|-------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `/api/og` | `app/api/og/route.ts`, `lib/og-canvas.ts`, `fonts/**`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile` | Request to `/api/og` | `drawCanvas()` creates a 1200x630 canvas, draws background/text/logo/icon layers, returns a PNG buffer, and `sharp` encodes WebP at quality 90. | Response sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`; route has a fixed image output path and cache granularity at the endpoint level. | Fonts: `arial.ttf` 915,212 bytes, `arial-bold.ttf` 57,448 bytes, `NotoSansSC-Black.ttf` 10,541,596 bytes. | Docker installs cairo, pango, jpeg, gif, rsvg, freetype, harfbuzz, fribidi, fontconfig, and curl for native image dependencies. | local counts, source-text only | `og-native-rendering` |
| Blog thumbnail route | `app/api/blog/[lang]/[slug]/thumbnail/[format]/route.ts`, `template.tsx`, `bgs/*.tsx`, `fonts/**` | `/api/blog/[lang]/[slug]/thumbnail/[format]` and static params | `generateStaticParams()` multiplies languages, posts, and three pregenerated formats; every render path loads three fonts and uses `satori` for SVG or `ImageResponse` for PNG. | Route path carries `lang`, `slug`, `format`, dimensions, and DPR; response sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`. | Five background TSX files total 156,597 bytes; largest are `WhatIsBg.tsx` at 2,847 lines / 82,149 bytes and `AppStoreChoicesBg.tsx` at 987 lines / 22,425 bytes. | Uses Next OG/ImageResponse, satori, local fonts, and static-export-sensitive route handling. | local counts, source-text only | `og-native-rendering` |
| Local fonts | `fonts/arial.ttf`, `fonts/arial-bold.ttf`, `fonts/NotoSansSC-Black.ttf` | Canvas and thumbnail renderers | Canvas registers all three fonts at module load; thumbnail renderer reads all three fonts with `Promise.all()` through `getFonts()`. | Font data is loaded from repository files; cache behavior is renderer/runtime dependent. | Total counted bytes: 11,514,256 across font files; combined font/background count command total included 11,670,853 bytes. | Font availability and native text shaping can differ by local shell, Docker builder, and hosting runtime. | local counts, source-text only | `og-native-rendering` |

### Network And Fan-Out Table

| Surface | Files | Trigger Path | Fan-Out / Network Work | Cache / State Evidence | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|---------|-------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Template generator | `scripts/generate-apps-api.js` | `npm run generate-apps`, `npm run build`, CI/Docker build | Fetches template list, serially processes templates, shells to `curl` for icon downloads, fetches template sources, and writes generated JSON. | Uses generated snapshots and optional clean mode; no bounded concurrency in the serial loop. | Build time scales with remote template latency, icon latency, accepted template count, and write churn. | source-text only | `remote-template-build-step` |
| Runtime App Store API and deploy source | `lib/api/apps-api.ts`, `hooks/use-template-source.ts`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `config/site.ts` | `/api/apps`, deploy click, deploy modal open | Runtime fetches remote templates and sorts converted apps; template-source hook imports local JSON and falls back to `${siteConfig.templateApiEndpoint}/api/getTemplateSource`. | Loader and hook state provide local/static fallback, loading, and error state. | Request and interaction latency can include remote API fetches, loops, sorts, and deploy-source fallback work. | source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| README and markdown interactions | `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/ReadmeMarkdownWindow.tsx`, `components/page-actions.tsx` | App detail README preview, copy/open markdown actions | README loader iterates candidates with `fetch(candidate.url, { cache: 'force-cache' })`; page actions fetch `markdownUrl`. | Uses platform cache hints for README fetches; interaction helpers fetch raw markdown on demand. | Detail and docs actions can wait for remote markdown and full text normalization/rendering. | source-text only | `app-detail-remote-readme`, `fumadocs-search-index` |
| Shared auth and email | `hooks/use-auth-redirect.ts`, `lib/utils/shared-auth.ts`, `new-components/AuthForm/**`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `config/site.ts` | Get started click, deploy click, auth modal email request/verify | `verifySharedAuth()` fetches `/api/auth/verifySharedToken` with credentials; auth form posts to email request and verify endpoints. | Browser/modal state decides redirect or auth form after network response. | Interaction completion can be gated by sequential shared-auth and email endpoint latency. | source-text only | `shared-auth-interaction-check` |
| Turnstile verification | `app/api/abuse/verify-turnstile/route.ts`, `app/[lang]/abuse/components/abuse-form.tsx`, `config/site.ts` | Abuse form submit | Client posts to `/api/abuse/verify-turnstile`; route parses JSON, updates a process-local `Map`, and posts to Cloudflare siteverify. | Rate-limit map cleans expired entries when size exceeds 1000; route uses forwarded IP and Cloudflare IP headers. | Request latency and failure behavior depend on external Turnstile verification and process-local rate-limit state. | source-text only | `turnstile-request-verification` |
| Analytics-adjacent paths | `components/analytics/**`, `hooks/use-gtm.ts`, `hooks/use-button-handler.ts`, `lib/gtm-utils.ts`, `app/[lang]/layout.tsx` | Page entry and button/video/share interactions | GTM, Clarity, Rybbit, Baidu, and Google Analytics script paths plus `trackButton` and `trackCustom` helpers. | Layout adds DNS prefetch/preconnect; script loading and bundle scoring are Phase 6 ownership. | Third-party analytics can affect page entry and interaction timing; full scoring remains in the frontend phase. | source-text only | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |

### Phase 5 Findings

| ID | status | severity | phase | files | entry point | module boundary | work type | execution timing | evidence | root cause | impact | remediation direction | validation coverage | duplicate key | dismissal rationale |

| PERF-506 | candidate | medium | 5 | `lib/api/apps-api.ts`, `hooks/use-template-source.ts`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `config/site.ts` | `/api/apps`, deploy modal template-source lookup | `lib`, `hooks`, `new-components`, `config` | network, CPU | request, interaction | `lib/api/apps-api.ts` fetches the template API, loops over templates, converts and sorts apps, then falls back to static apps; `hooks/use-template-source.ts` imports local JSON and fetches `${siteConfig.templateApiEndpoint}/api/getTemplateSource` on misses before deploy modal state resolves. | Runtime App Store and deploy paths mix remote API fetches, per-template conversion, sorting, local JSON fallback, and remote template-source fallback. | Request and deploy-click latency can vary by remote template API health and local snapshot completeness. | Consolidate runtime/static shape contracts, make remote fallbacks explicit in UX/state, and add timing/fallback probes behind external-service guards. | source-text only | `app-store-data-pipeline` | n/a |

### Phase 5 Skipped Validation

| Validation | Status | Reason | Guard For Future Run | Validation Coverage |
|------------|--------|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `npm run build` | skipped | It runs `npm run generate-apps` first and can call remote APIs, download icons, and rewrite generated data/assets. | Capture generated-file diff before and after. | manual only |
| `npm run build:analyze` | skipped | It runs the generator first, and bundle scoring belongs to Phase 6. | Use Phase 6 bundle plan with generated-file guard. | manual only |
| `npm run generate-apps` | skipped | It calls remote template APIs, shells to `curl`, writes JSON, and can change app images. | Run only with explicit generated snapshot timing objective and diff guard. | manual only |
| `/api/og` endpoint load | skipped | It executes native canvas/Sharp rendering and depends on static-export/hosting context. | Single local smoke under Node 20 with no load loop. | manual only |
| Blog thumbnail endpoint load | skipped | It can execute font reads, satori, and ImageResponse rendering. | Single local smoke under Node 20 with no load loop. | manual only |
| Docker build | skipped | Native dependency and deployment parity belong to Phase 7. | Docker-capable environment with cache state recorded. | unvalidated |
| Production endpoint stress | skipped | v1 audit excludes production load testing. | Separate operational approval and rate limits. | unvalidated |
| External Turnstile/auth/template API probes | skipped | Probes would send real traffic to external services. | Use source evidence in Phase 5; add explicit service guard later. | source-text only |

### Phase 5 Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Environment snapshot | Gap recorded on 2026-06-11 | `node --version` returned `v24.13.0`, `npm --version` returned `11.6.2`, `.nvmrc` is `20`, `.source` returned `SOURCE_MISSING`, branch output was `HEAD`, symbolic ref returned `DETACHED`, and pre-existing unrelated changes were present in `.planning/config.json` and `.planning/phases/01-audit-ledger-and-module-inventory/01-RESEARCH.md`. |

| Guarded checks | Skipped on 2026-06-11 | Build, analyzer, generator refresh, endpoint load, Docker build, production stress, and external service probes were skipped per Phase 5 audit-only scope. |

## Phase 6: Shared Shell, Bundle, Assets, and Interaction Performance

Phase 6 establishes the shared localized shell as the baseline every localized
route can inherit, then records route-local bundle, asset, media, animation,
hydration, and interaction findings as incremental cost above that baseline.
The evidence refresh used source/count commands only. Analyzer, build,
generator, Docker, browser trace, production probe, package install/update,
asset rewriting, and external auth/Turnstile/template calls stayed skipped
because the build/analyzer path invokes generated app refreshes and those
commands can mutate generated JSON or public app images.

### Environment Snapshot

| Command | Key Output | Phase 6 Meaning |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| `pwd` | `/Users/longnv/.codex/worktrees/85a0/sealos.io` | Execution ran in the requested worktree. |
| `node --version` | `v24.13.0` | Local shell differs from the canonical `.nvmrc` Node 20 runtime; report evidence remains source/count only. |
| `npm --version` | `11.6.2` | npm was observed without installing or updating packages. |
| `cat .nvmrc` | `20` | Project runtime remains Node 20. |
| `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` | `HEAD` | Worktree is detached in this shell. |
| `git symbolic-ref --quiet HEAD || echo DETACHED` | `DETACHED` | Commit safety requires special handling; audit edits remain scoped. |
| `test -d .source && echo SOURCE_PRESENT || echo SOURCE_MISSING` | `SOURCE_MISSING` | Fumadocs generated source is absent, so build/analyzer checks stay skipped. |

### Shared Shell Baseline

| Surface | Scope | Evidence | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|---------|-------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Locale layout shell | shared shell baseline | `app/[lang]/layout.tsx` imports `Analytics`, `GTMBody`, `DefaultSearchDialog`, `HomepageDarkMode`, `ConditionalSiteBanner`, `AuthFormProvider`, `DeployModalProvider`, `AuthForm`, and `DeployModal`, then mounts them around every localized route. | Every localized route can inherit provider, modal, analytics, search, and shell hydration before route-local content runs. | source-text only | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |
| Analytics and GTM body | shared shell baseline | `components/analytics/index.tsx` contains timers, interaction listeners, script loaders, and analytics providers; `components/analytics/gtm-body.tsx` contributes the GTM iframe fallback. | Third-party script scheduling and listeners are part of the page-entry baseline. | source-text only | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |
| Fumadocs provider and search | shared shell baseline plus reused search key | `app/[lang]/layout.tsx` passes `DefaultSearchDialog`; `components/docs/Search.tsx` uses `useDocsSearch` with static Orama search and Mandarin tokenizer. | Docs search client code is reachable from the shared provider, while payload/index growth remains the Phase 4 search key. | source-text only | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `fumadocs-search-index` |
| Shared auth and deploy modals | shared shell baseline plus reused auth key | `new-components/AuthForm/**`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `hooks/use-auth-redirect.ts`, and `hooks/use-template-source.ts` combine Radix dialogs, Motion animation, Turnstile, email endpoints, shared-auth verification, and template-source lookup. | Globally mounted modal providers and interaction code add route-wide hydration reach; request-time auth and Turnstile behavior reuses Phase 5 ownership. | source-text only | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `shared-auth-interaction-check`, `turnstile-request-verification` |
| Header and footer shell | shared shell baseline | `new-components/Header.tsx` imports Motion, Radix navigation, Lucide icons, GTM/auth helpers, and scroll state; `new-components/Footer/SealosSticky.tsx` uses Motion scroll state, `requestAnimationFrame`, scroll, and resize listeners. | Shared navigation and footer code can add first-load bundle and scroll scheduling cost across routes that use the new shell. | source-text only | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |

### Client Boundary Inventory

| Group | Count | Evidence | Performance Reason |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------------|
| All client boundaries in audited frontend paths | 177 | `rg -l "^'use client'\|^\"use client\"" app components new-components hooks \| sort \| wc -l` returned `177`. | Client boundary count gives a source-level ceiling for hydration and route chunk surfaces before analyzer confirmation. |
| Shared shell and shared UI surfaces | 77 observed in research grouping | Phase 6 research grouped 28 shared shell files and 49 shared/UI primitive files from the 177 client files. | Shared boundaries can be inherited by many routes and should be separated from route-local incremental costs. |
| New-home route-local visual surfaces | 26 observed in research grouping | Phase 6 research grouped new-home files under `app/[lang]/(home)/(new-home)/**`. | Visual route costs are incremental above the shared shell baseline. |
| App Store, product, docs/blog/content, customer, and solution surfaces | 68 observed in research grouping | Phase 6 research grouped App Store 8, product 8, docs/blog/content 24, customers 8, and solutions 20. | These surfaces should keep route ownership when findings are scored. |

### Bundle Dependency Map

| Dependency / Surface | Source Trace | Route Ownership | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `motion/react` | Import scan found Motion traces in shared header/footer, AuthForm, DeployModal, animated UI primitives, DevBox, customer TOC, and new-home sections. | shared shell and route-local | Scroll state, in-view checks, animated dialogs, and route-local visual effects can add bundle and scheduling cost. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `visual-animation-loop-cost`, `customer-interaction-scheduling` |
| `framer-motion` | Import scan found Framer Motion traces in new-home components such as prompt, workflow, caps, hero, and carousel sections. | new-home route-local | Route-local Framer Motion imports are incremental above the shared shell baseline. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `visual-animation-loop-cost` |
| `matter-js` | `app/[lang]/(home)/(new-home)/components/FallingTags.tsx` imports `matter-js`. | new-home route-local | Physics engine work and rAF loops belong to the visual-heavy route. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `visual-animation-loop-cost` |
| `react-player/lazy` | `components/video.tsx` dynamically imports `react-player/lazy`. | product/video interaction | Player code is delayed until the video component path but still belongs to media interaction scoring. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `visual-animation-loop-cost` |
| `mermaid` | `components/mdx/mermaid.tsx` dynamically imports `mermaid`. | docs/blog MDX widget | Mermaid is route-local docs/blog widget work, while search/content payload ownership remains Phase 4. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `fumadocs-search-index` |
| `lucide-react` | Import scan found Lucide traces across shared header, UI components, App Store, product, solution, customer, blog, comparison, and AI quick reference surfaces. | shared shell and route-local | Icon imports have broad ownership; `next.config.mjs` attempts package import optimization for `lucide-react`. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |
| Radix UI | Import scan found Radix dialogs, navigation menu, dropdown, select, switch, tooltip, visually hidden, and icon primitives across shared modals, new-home modal, UI primitives, and App Store states. | shared shell and route-local | Accessible primitives add client bundle and interaction behavior; ownership depends on mounted route. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `visual-animation-loop-cost` |
| Fumadocs UI | `app/[lang]/layout.tsx`, docs layouts/pages, blog article pages, and `components/docs/Search.tsx` import Fumadocs UI/provider/search/page components. | shared shell and docs/blog | Fumadocs provider/search are shell-reachable; docs/blog rendering is route-local. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `fumadocs-search-index` |

### Asset Inventory

| Asset Group | Count / Size | Largest / Risky Files | Performance Reason | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `public` | 16,728 KB | `public/images/quick-start.png` 1,065,159 bytes; `public/ai-faqs.en.json` 790,807 bytes; customer PNGs above 500 KB. | Static export serves these assets directly, so transfer and cache behavior depend on source size and host policy. | local counts | `static-export-asset-delivery` |
| `assets` | 1,204 KB | `assets/hero-grid.svg` 240,230 bytes; `assets/video-thumbnail.svg` 183,458 bytes. | Imported assets can affect route chunks or first-viewport visual transfer depending on component ownership. | local counts | `static-export-asset-delivery`, `visual-animation-loop-cost` |
| `fonts` | 11,252 KB across 3 files | `fonts/NotoSansSC-Black.ttf` 10,541,596 bytes; `fonts/arial.ttf` 915,212 bytes. | Browser/static delivery belongs to Phase 6 asset inventory; native renderer input remains `og-native-rendering`. | local counts | `static-export-asset-delivery`, `og-native-rendering` |
| `public/images` | 14,924 KB | Customer, DevBox, dashboard, archive, banner, and app images dominate the largest local files list. | Image transfer risk is cross-route and static-export-sensitive. | local counts | `static-export-asset-delivery` |
| `public/images/apps` | 4,604 KB | Largest observed app files include `happy-server.png` 608,306 bytes, `rybbit.png` 389,192 bytes, and `eaglercraft-server.svg` 151,997 bytes. | App media density is App Store-owned when rooted in generated media shape; generic static delivery remains Phase 6. | local counts | `app-store-data-pipeline`, `static-export-asset-delivery` |
| Extension mix | 483 files total: 264 SVG, 170 PNG, 18 ICO, 13 JPG, 5 WEBP, 5 JPEG, 3 TTF, plus single manifest/text/json/header/redirect files. | SVG and PNG dominate file count; local font bytes dominate size. | Extension mix highlights optimization targets for image policy, SVG policy, and font delivery. | local counts | `static-export-asset-delivery` |

### Image Policy

| Config Surface | Evidence | Static Export Implication | Validation Coverage | Duplicate Key |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `images.unoptimized: true` | `next.config.mjs` sets `images.unoptimized: true`. | Browser receives source/remote image assets without Next image optimization output in static export. | source-text only | `static-export-asset-delivery` |
| Remote image hosts | `next.config.mjs` allows `oss.laf.run`, `images.tryfastgpt.ai`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `images.sealos.run`, and `raw.githubusercontent.com`. | Remote image latency and cache behavior can vary outside the static export artifact. | source-text only | `static-export-asset-delivery`, `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| SVG policy | `next.config.mjs` sets `dangerouslyAllowSVG: true` and a restrictive `contentSecurityPolicy`. | SVG delivery is allowed and must rely on source hygiene, CSP, and host headers. | source-text only | `static-export-asset-delivery` |
| Cache TTL | `next.config.mjs` sets `minimumCacheTTL: 60`. | Static export and host behavior can dominate effective image caching. | source-text only | `static-export-asset-delivery` |
| Package import optimization | `next.config.mjs` includes `optimizePackageImports` for `fumadocs-ui`, `fumadocs-core`, `lucide-react`, `motion`, and selected Radix packages. | The config attempts bundle import optimization, but analyzer confirmation is deferred behind generated-file guards. | source-text only; analyzer skipped | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |

### Interaction Trace

| App detail README and media | `app/[lang]/products/app-store/[slug]/components/ReadmeMarkdownWindow.tsx`, `Screenshots.tsx`, `AppPreviewPanel.tsx` | `fetch(candidate.url)`, `ReactMarkdown`, screenshot/image rendering. | route-local incremental above shared shell | README fetch/render and media density can delay detail-page content and interactions. | `app-detail-remote-readme`, `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| Docs search and Mermaid | `components/docs/Search.tsx`, `components/mdx/mermaid.tsx` | `useDocsSearch`, static Orama search, dynamic `import('mermaid')`, SVG render state. | shared shell search plus route-local widget | Search is shell-reachable; Mermaid is route-local docs/blog client widget work. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `fumadocs-search-index` |
| Auth, deploy, and Turnstile | `new-components/AuthForm/**`, `new-components/DeployModal/**`, `hooks/use-auth-redirect.ts`, `app/[lang]/abuse/components/abuse-form.tsx` | Dialog state, Motion animation, email request/verify fetches, shared-auth fetches, Turnstile widget callbacks. | shared shell plus route-specific abuse | User actions can wait on auth/deploy checks or request-time Turnstile verification. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `shared-auth-interaction-check`, `turnstile-request-verification` |
| New-home visuals and video | `app/[lang]/(home)/(new-home)/**`, `new-components/GodRays.tsx` | `requestAnimationFrame`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `IntersectionObserver`, `ResizeObserver`, `useInView`, `useScroll`, Matter engine update loop, YouTube iframe `postMessage`. | route-local incremental above shared shell | Visual loops, physics, scroll transforms, observers, and media modal work can affect main-thread scheduling. | `visual-animation-loop-cost` |
| Customer route interactions | `app/[lang]/customers/**` | TOC heading extraction timers, scroll/resize listeners, rAF bounds updates, testimonial interval, customer markdown render. | route-local incremental above shared shell | Customer pages add timers/listeners/filtering/markdown work beyond the shell. | `customer-interaction-scheduling` |
| AI FAQ client search | `app/[lang]/(home)/ai-quick-reference/components/FAQSearch.tsx` | Fetches `/ai-faqs.en.json`, uses Fuse filtering and debounced search/pagination. | route-local incremental above shared shell | A 790,807-byte JSON payload is fetched client-side before search can operate. | `fumadocs-search-index`, `static-export-asset-delivery` |

### Phase 6 Skipped Validation

| Validation | Status | Reason | Guard For Future Run | Validation Coverage |
|------------|--------|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `npm run build:analyze` | skipped | `package.json` runs `npm run generate-apps` before `ANALYZE=true next build`, and the generator can call remote template APIs, download icons, and rewrite generated JSON/app images. | Add before/after guards for `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, `public/images/apps`, `out`, analyzer output, and source/content/public diffs. | manual only |
| `npm run build` | skipped | Build invokes generated App Store refresh before Next build and can mutate generated artifacts. | Run only with generated-file diff guard and Node 20 runtime. | manual only |
| `npm run generate-apps` and `npm run generate-apps:clean` | skipped | Generator and clean mode can call remote services, shell to `curl`, write JSON, and rewrite or recreate app images. | Use a dedicated generated-artifact timing task with explicit diff review. | manual only |
| Docker build | skipped | Docker build installs dependencies, rewrites image paths, and runs `npm run build`, crossing package/build/generator/deployment boundaries. | Phase 7 deployment parity run in Docker-capable environment with cache and generated-file guards. | unvalidated |
| Dev server, browser trace, and visual inspection | skipped | Phase 6 made report-only edits and used source-trigger evidence; browser traces would add runtime noise and require a served app. | Run guarded browser traces after analyzer/source guards and without source mutations. | manual only |
| Production probes and endpoint polling | skipped | External service and production traffic are outside Phase 6 audit-only scope. | Separate operational approval, rate limits, and service ownership. | unvalidated |
| Auth, Turnstile, template, README, and analytics external calls | skipped | Live calls could hit external services and change request/account state. | Use mocked/local route smoke or explicit service guard in later validation. | source-text only |
| Package install/update and asset rewriting | skipped | Package files, generated data, public assets, fonts, and source assets are read-only for this plan. | Later fix phase with package legitimacy and asset diff gates. | n/a |

## Phase 7: Deployment Parity, Validation Gaps, and Prioritized Findings

Phase 7 closes the v1 audit as a report-only pass. It records deployment
parity, dependency/runtime baseline, validation coverage, skipped validation
guards, final finding counts, duplicate-key ownership, and grouped remediation
order. Direct fixes, package changes, generated refreshes, builds, analyzer
runs, Docker builds, deploys, browser traces, production probes, and external
service calls remain follow-up scope.

### Phase 7 Source Evidence Refresh

| Evidence Area | Result | Source / Command | Validation Coverage |
|---------------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Local runtime caveat | `.nvmrc` is `20`; local shell is Node `v24.13.0` and npm `11.6.2`. | `pwd && node --version && npm --version && cat .nvmrc` | tested |
| Dependency state caveat | `node_modules` is absent and `.source` is absent. | `test -d node_modules`, `test -d .source` | tested |
| Phase 6 count baseline | Current report had 34 `PERF-*` candidate rows before Phase 7 additions. | Node report parser over `docs/performance-audit.md` | tested |
| Final finding count | candidate: 36, confirmed: 0, dismissed: 0, deferred: 0 | Two Phase 7 candidate rows added: PERF-701 and PERF-702. | tested |
| Deployment command scan | Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Docker/Nginx, GHCR, and Kubernetes command surfaces are present. | `rg -n "node-version: 20|npm install|npm ci|vercel build|pages deploy|docker/build-push-action|kubectl set image|/app/out|/usr/share/nginx/html" .github/workflows/*.yml Dockerfile package.json` | tested |
| Header/redirect/static export scan | Vercel headers/redirects, Cloudflare `_headers`/`_redirects`, static export, image policy, analyzer flag, and build scripts are present. | `rg -n "headers|redirects|Cache-Control|_headers|_redirects|robots.txt|output: 'export'|trailingSlash|unoptimized|remotePatterns|ANALYZE|generate-apps|normalize-root-locale" vercel.json public/_headers public/_redirects next.config.mjs package.json` | tested |
| Dependency lockfile scan | Package ranges and lockfile exact versions were parsed for Next, `@next/*`, MDX, Fumadocs, React, TypeScript, `canvas`, `sharp`, and `satori`. | Node JSON parser over `package.json` and `package-lock.json` | tested |
| Scoped audit-only diff | Protected source, content, generated data, deployment config, package files, scripts, hooks, fonts, assets, and public paths had no Phase 7 diff. | `git diff --name-only -- app components new-components lib config content source.config.ts next.config.mjs vercel.json public .github Dockerfile package.json package-lock.json scripts hooks fonts assets` | tested |

### Dependency and Runtime Baseline

Package ranges are recorded beside lockfile exact versions because Phase 7
uses the lockfile as the reproducibility source for DEPS-01 and DEPS-02.

| Package / Runtime | `package.json` Range | Lockfile / Local Exact Version | Audit Meaning |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| `next` | `^14.2.28` | `14.2.28` | Application runtime and static export baseline. |
| `@next/bundle-analyzer` | `^15.4.1` | `15.4.1` | Analyzer package is one major line ahead of Next runtime baseline. |
| `@next/mdx` | `^15.2.0` | `15.3.0` | MDX integration package is one major line ahead of Next runtime baseline. |
| `@mdx-js/loader` | `^3.1.0` | `3.1.0` | MDX loader baseline for content compilation. |
| `@mdx-js/react` | `^3.1.0` | `3.1.0` | MDX React runtime baseline. |
| `fumadocs-core` | `^15.2.6` | `15.2.8` | Docs/search/source loader baseline. |
| `fumadocs-ui` | `^15.2.8` | `15.2.8` | Docs UI and search client baseline. |
| `fumadocs-mdx` | `^11.5.8` | `11.5.8` | Postinstall/source generation baseline. |
| `react` | `^18.3.1` | `18.3.1` | UI runtime baseline. |
| `react-dom` | `^18.3.1` | `18.3.1` | DOM renderer baseline. |
| `typescript` | `^5.5.4` | `5.8.3` | Typecheck baseline. |
| `canvas` | `^3.1.0` | `3.1.0` | Native image generation dependency linked to Docker native libraries and OG paths. |
| `sharp` | `^0.33.5` | `0.33.5` | Native image processing dependency linked to OG and thumbnail paths. |
| `satori` | `^0.18.3` | `0.18.3` | Dynamic image rendering dependency. |
| Node | `.nvmrc` `20` | Local shell `v24.13.0`; workflow/Docker Node 20 evidence | Local validation caveat; CI/Docker baseline is Node 20. |
| npm / lockfile | npm lockfile v3 | Local npm `11.6.2`; `package-lock.json` lockfile version `3` | Package install/update and typecheck/build validation are environment-gated. |
| Generated dependency state | n/a | `node_modules` absent; `.source` absent | `npm run lint`, package-dependent tests, build, analyzer, and Fumadocs-generated-source validation stayed skipped. |

### Validation Coverage Matrix

Primary coverage labels in this matrix use only `tested`, `source-text only`,
`typecheck only`, `manual only`, and `unvalidated`. Details preserve the

### Consolidated Skipped Validation

| Skipped Validation | Primary Label | Rationale | Future Guard |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Package installs and updates | unvalidated | Install/update commands can change lockfiles or dependency state and were outside the allowed Phase 7 scope. | Package legitimacy review, Node 20, isolated dependency phase, lockfile diff review. |
| `npm run lint` / typecheck | manual only | `node_modules` is absent and local Node is `v24.13.0` while the project baseline is Node 20. | Install locked deps in Node 20 and run with no package diff. |
| Node tests importing app dependencies | manual only | Tests can require dependencies unavailable without `node_modules`; prior Phase 3 utility test had `tests 0`. | Node 20 plus locked deps; preserve `tests 0` gap until test is improved. |
| `npm run generate-apps` and `generate-apps:clean` | manual only | Generator can call remote template APIs, shell to `curl`, write JSON, and rewrite or recreate `public/images/apps`. | Before/after diff guard for `config/apps.json`, `config/template-sources.json`, and `public/images/apps`. |
| `npm run build` | manual only | Build invokes generated App Store refresh before Next build. | Generated-file diff guard, Node 20, installed deps, separate generator timing. |
| `npm run build:analyze` | manual only | Analyzer command invokes generated App Store refresh before `ANALYZE=true next build`. | Generated-file diff guard for generated app files, `out`, and analyzer output. |
| Docker build | unvalidated | Docker crosses package install, native libraries, image path rewrite, generator, Next build, and image artifact boundaries. | Docker-capable environment, disposable tag, generated-file diff guard. |
| Vercel, Cloudflare, GHCR, Kubernetes deploys | unvalidated | Deploys require credentials, create external artifacts, and can affect hosted state. | Preview-only deployment plan with rollback and secret handling. |
| Endpoint load tests and production probes | unvalidated | External probes can create traffic and measure host state outside report-only scope. | Approved rate limits, preview target, and no stress testing. |
| Browser traces and visual inspection | manual only | Requires a served app and can mix local runtime noise with source-only evidence. | Local Node 20 build or dev server after dependency state is established. |
| Auth, Turnstile, template API, README, analytics calls | source-text only | Live calls depend on secrets, external services, account state, or third-party traffic. | Mocked tests first; approved minimal service smoke later. |
| Generated app refreshes | manual only | Refresh can mutate JSON and image assets. | Dedicated generated artifact task with diff review. |
| Asset rewriting | manual only | `scripts/replace-image-paths.sh` can mutate paths during Docker build flow. | Disposable copy or explicit before/after diff guard. |

### Final Traceability

| Requirement | Closeout Evidence |
|-------------|-------------------|
| DEPS-01 | Dependency and Runtime Baseline records package ranges, lockfile exact versions, Node baseline, npm lockfile version, absent `node_modules`, and absent `.source`. |
| DEPS-02 | PERF-702 records the Next, `@next/*`, MDX, Fumadocs, analyzer, lockfile, and runtime alignment caveat with package/lockfile/config evidence. |
| DEPLOY-01 | Phase 7 Deployment Parity Matrix records Vercel, Cloudflare, Docker/Nginx, GHCR, and Kubernetes source evidence. |
| DEPLOY-02 | PERF-701 and the parity matrix compare install/build/env/artifact/serving/redirect/header/cache/route/native behavior by deployment target. |
| VERIFY-01 | Validation Coverage Matrix covers module boundaries and detailed findings PERF-201 through PERF-609 plus PERF-701 and PERF-702. |
| VERIFY-02 | Consolidated Skipped Validation records safe guards for build, analyzer, generator, Docker, endpoint load, browser trace, production probes, external calls, package changes, generated refreshes, and asset rewriting. |
| VERIFY-03 | Final finding counts are `candidate: 36, confirmed: 0, dismissed: 0, deferred: 0`, and remediation is grouped by duplicate key/root cause. |

This phase is report-only. Fix execution, dependency changes, generated refreshes,
deployment changes, hosted probes, browser traces, and broader measurements are
follow-up scope.

### Phase 7 Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Environment snapshot | Gap recorded on 2026-06-11 | `node --version` returned `v24.13.0`, `npm --version` returned `11.6.2`, `.nvmrc` is `20`, `node_modules` returned `NODE_MODULES_ABSENT`, and `.source` returned `SOURCE_ABSENT`. |
| Deployment source scan | Passed on 2026-06-11 | `rg` found Node 20, `npm install`, `npm ci`, Vercel build/deploy, Cloudflare Pages deploy, Docker build-push, Kubernetes update, Docker static output, and Nginx serving evidence. |
| Header/static export scan | Passed on 2026-06-11 | `rg` found Vercel headers/redirects, Cloudflare `_headers` and `_redirects`, `/robots.txt` rewrite, `output: 'export'`, `trailingSlash`, `unoptimized`, `remotePatterns`, `ANALYZE`, generator, and normalization evidence. |
| Dependency baseline scan | Passed on 2026-06-11 | Node package parser returned required package ranges and lockfile versions, including `next` 14.2.28, `@next/bundle-analyzer` 15.4.1, `@next/mdx` 15.3.0, Fumadocs packages, React 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.8.3, `canvas` 3.1.0, `sharp` 0.33.5, `satori` 0.18.3, and lockfile version 3. |

| Scoped audit-only diff | Passed on 2026-06-11 | Protected source, content, generated data, deployment config, package files, scripts, hooks, fonts, assets, and public paths returned empty diff after Phase 7 edits. |

## Phase 11: Shared Shell Bundle and Hydration Remediation

Phase 11 turns the Phase 6 `shared-layout-bundle-cost` audit finding into
source-level lazy boundaries for docs search, auth, deploy, and template-source
data reach. This phase preserves public hooks and user-visible flows while
reducing shared locale shell reach. Accepted bundle movement still requires a
Node 20 locked-dependency analyzer run because the current shell is Node
`v24.13.0`, `node_modules` is absent, `out` is absent, and analyzer artifacts
are absent.

### Phase 11 Source Changes

| Requirement | PERF Trace | Evidence | Validation Coverage |
|-------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| SHELL-01 | PERF-601, PERF-602, PERF-603 | `app/[lang]/layout.tsx` now wires `RootProvider.search.SearchDialog` to `components/docs/LazySearchDialog.tsx`. Auth and deploy remain mounted as thin facades, while heavy inner dialogs load after open intent. | tested source guard; analyzer caveat |
| SHELL-02 | PERF-603 | `new-components/AuthForm/index.tsx` lazy-loads `AuthFormInner` after `useAuthForm().open`. `new-components/DeployModal/index.tsx` lazy-loads `DeployModalInner` after `useDeployModal().open`. `new-components/AuthForm/auth-email-actions.ts` owns email validation/request work and loads from `sendCode()` after auth intent. | tested source guard |
| SHELL-03 | PERF-601, PERF-607, PERF-609 | `components/docs/Search.tsx` continues to own `SharedProps`, `useDocsSearch`, Orama, Mandarin tokenizer, and `useParams`. `components/docs/LazySearchDialog.tsx` is the Fumadocs bridge from the shared shell. `/api/search` route semantics remain anchored to Phase 10. | tested source guard |
| SHELL-04 | PERF-601, PERF-602, PERF-603, PERF-702 | `.planning/phases/11-shared-shell-bundle-and-hydration/11-VALIDATION.md` records shared locale shell, route-local entries, analytics, auth, deploy, docs search, new header/footer, and legacy header/footer evidence plus current-shell caveats. | source guard passed; analyzer caveat |

### Phase 11 Surface Traceability

| Surface | Before 11-02 | After 11-02 | Duplicate Key |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| shared locale shell | `app/[lang]/layout.tsx` reached `DefaultSearchDialog` directly and globally mounted auth/deploy surfaces. | The layout reaches `LazySearchDialog`, `AuthForm`, and `DeployModal` facades. Heavy search/auth/deploy internals are behind lazy imports. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |
| docs search | Search dialog, Orama, and Mandarin tokenizer were reachable through the layout import path. | `LazySearchDialog` dynamically imports `components/docs/Search.tsx`; search behavior stays in the existing Fumadocs dialog implementation. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `fumadocs-search-index` |
| auth | `AuthForm` eagerly imported Radix/Motion/GodRays form internals, while email validation/request code lived in the command context. | `AuthForm` renders only after open intent and lazy-loads `AuthFormInner`; `sendCode()` dynamically loads `auth-email-actions.ts`. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `shared-auth-interaction-check` |
| deploy | `DeployModal` eagerly imported dialog internals, `DeployModalContext` eagerly reached template-source hook code, and `hooks/use-template-source.ts` statically imported `config/template-sources.json`. | `DeployModal` renders only after open intent and lazy-loads `DeployModalInner`; `openDeployModal()` dynamically imports `loadTemplateSource()`; `loadTemplateSource()` dynamically imports `@/config/template-sources.json` and keeps API fallback semantics. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, `app-store-data-pipeline` |
| analytics | GTM fallback was tracked as a shared shell surface. | `components/analytics/gtm-body.tsx` remains server-renderable fallback markup using `analyticsConfig` and the same noscript iframe intent. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |
| header and footer | New and legacy header/footer systems were measured as route chrome surfaces. | Guard evidence still names `new-components/Header.tsx`, `new-components/Footer/**`, `components/header/**`, and `components/footer/**` for SHELL-04 grouping. | `shared-layout-bundle-cost` |

### Phase 11 Validation

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `node --test scripts/check-shell-bundle-baseline.test.mjs` | Passed on 2026-06-12 | 5 tests passed for surface collection, lazy-boundary fixtures, regression failures, analyzer caveats, and command/caveat output. |
| `npm run shell-bundle:check` | Passed on 2026-06-12 | Source lazy-boundary checks passed; analyzer artifacts reported `SKIPPED_WITH_CAVEAT` because Node is `v24.13.0`, `node_modules` is absent, `out` is absent, and analyzer HTML artifacts are absent. |
| `npm run app-store:diff` | Passed on 2026-06-12 | Apps `150`, template source keys `150`, changed paths `0`. |
| `npm run build:analyze:timed` | Caveated on 2026-06-12 | Pre generated diff guard passed; Next analyzer build exited `1` because the current shell has no installed dependencies. Accepted analyzer movement evidence requires Node 20 with installed locked dependencies. |
| `npm run static-output:check` | Passed with caveat on 2026-06-12 | Source checks and route policy passed; `out` artifact inspection was skipped because `out` is absent and the locked build gate is closed. |
| `npm run validate:deployment` | Passed on 2026-06-12 | Deployment parity source check passed; nested App Store diff passed; static-output check passed with `out` caveat; Docker smoke stayed behind its closed unsafe gate. |

Phase 11 closes the source-level remediation trace for SHELL-01, SHELL-02,
SHELL-03, SHELL-04, `shared-layout-bundle-cost`, PERF-601, PERF-602, PERF-603,
PERF-607, PERF-609, and PERF-702. Native OG/blog thumbnail rendering remains
Phase 12 ownership. Representative browser trace closeout remains Phase 13
ownership.

## Phase 13: Validation Closeout and Final v2 Audit Status

Phase 13 closes VALIDATE-02 and VALIDATE-03 for the v2 remediation set. The
browser trace closeout path is safe by default: `browser-trace:check` records
the representative route matrix and external-service controls while
`PHASE9_RUN_BROWSER_TRACE` is closed. Accepted navigation trace evidence remains
behind the explicit open gate
`PHASE9_RUN_BROWSER_TRACE=1 PHASE9_BROWSER_TRACE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 npm run browser-trace:run`.

### Phase 13 Browser Trace Closeout

| Evidence | Result | Caveat / next gate |
|----------|--------|--------------------|
| `node --test scripts/check-browser-trace-closeout.test.mjs` | 6 tests passed for closed gate behavior, open-gate blockers, route fixtures, external controls, package scripts, and injectable environment helpers. | validated |
| `npm run browser-trace:check` | Printed `SKIPPED_WITH_CAVEAT`, exit code `0`, route rows for `/en`, `/en/docs`, `/en/docs/guides/app-deploy/first-deploy`, `/en/products/app-store`, `/en/products/app-store/n8n`, `/api/og`, and two blog thumbnail fixtures. | validated with caveat; accepted navigation evidence requires the `PHASE9_RUN_BROWSER_TRACE` open gate with Node 20, installed dependencies, generated `.source`, `out`, a local target, and an approved browser adapter. |
| External-service controls | Analytics, auth, Turnstile, template API, GitHub README, hosted-preview, production, and deploy requests are listed as blocked or stubbed controls by the trace guard. | validated with caveat; interaction traces that click auth, deploy, or App Store controls require mocked or blocked network outcomes. |

### Final v2 Audit Status Matrix

## Handoff

Later phases should update this report in place:

1. Add detailed findings using the [Finding Schema](#finding-schema).
2. Reuse duplicate keys from [Duplicate-Key Policy](#duplicate-key-policy) when
   root cause and remediation path are shared.
3. Promote seed notes into detailed findings only after phase-owned evidence is
   collected.
4. Record validation coverage as `tested`, `source-text only`,
   `typecheck only`, `manual only`, or `unvalidated`.
5. Keep direct performance fixes for v2 fix execution after v1 audit coverage
   is complete.
